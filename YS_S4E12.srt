2
00:00:02,732 --> 00:00:04,335
You can't be my lab assistant.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,749
There's a wait list of students

4
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:08,039
and I just can't give you
special treatment.

5
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:09,554
Not with that attitude.

6
00:00:11,452 --> 00:00:12,765
Hello?

7
00:00:12,867 --> 00:00:14,132
Can I be your lab assistant?

8
00:00:14,216 --> 00:00:16,414
If I say yes, will you
please stop hounding me?

9
00:00:16,506 --> 00:00:18,595
- Absolutely.
- Fine, you win.

10
00:00:19,508 --> 00:00:20,929
I understand my role here.

11
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:23,257
In fact, I noticed a flaw
in your reaction rate,

12
00:00:23,342 --> 00:00:25,222
but I kept it to myself
because I know my place.

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,361
- What is it?
- Nice try.

14
00:00:27,664 --> 00:00:29,016
Fire!

15
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,304
Fire!

16
00:00:30,389 --> 00:00:32,307
Was it too much oxygen
in the reagents?

17
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:34,715
See, you didn't need
my help after all.

18
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:42,552
<i>My role
as Dr. Linkletter's lab</i> assistant

19
00:00:42,636 --> 00:00:44,162
<i>was progressing nicely.</i>

20
00:00:44,246 --> 00:00:47,382
<i>I had mastered operating
the manual particle collector,</i>

21
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:49,602
<i>AKA a broom.</i>

22
00:00:49,687 --> 00:00:51,386
<i>I may not always recognize</i>

23
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,388
<i>sarcasm,
but I sure know how to use it.</i>

24
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:54,836
Sheldon,

25
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,435
I've hit a bit of a roadblock

26
00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:58,393
with the solar
neutrino detector.

27
00:00:58,477 --> 00:01:00,047
Why don't you come have a look?

28
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:03,529
Are you saying you would like
meto take part in your experiment?

29
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:06,750
Well, I think a fresh set
of eyes might be helpful.

30
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:09,579
Because my previous
observationsproved correct?

31
00:01:09,663 --> 00:01:11,273
Yes.

32
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:13,929
And had you listened to me, the
lab wouldn't have caught fire?

33
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:15,062
Yes.

34
00:01:15,147 --> 00:01:16,934
So just to be clear,
at the tender age of 11,

35
00:01:17,018 --> 00:01:19,414
I'll be officially participatingin
an academic study.

36
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:20,720
Will you do it or not?

37
00:01:20,804 --> 00:01:22,461
Absolutely. Here you go.

38
00:01:22,545 --> 00:01:24,419
What am I supposed to do
with this?

39
00:01:24,503 --> 00:01:26,983
Well, if you can't figure thatout,
no wonder you need my help.

40
00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:32,078
<i>♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪</i>

41
00:01:32,163 --> 00:01:34,647

<i>♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪</i>

45
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:50,097
Do we have another
hair dryer?

46
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:51,577
This one broke.

47
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:53,623
Just use a towel.

48
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:55,102
So my hair can look like yours?

49
00:01:55,186 --> 00:01:56,797
I don't think so.

50
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,454
Go look in the garage.

51
00:01:59,538 --> 00:02:00,670
Thank you.

52
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,462
I like my hair.

53
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:09,639
<i>I may have been
part of an academic study,</i>

54
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:11,205

00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:14,007

57
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,856
I'm gonna be rich.

58
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,032
Missy, ten minutes.

59
00:02:25,116 --> 00:02:26,512
Okay.

60
00:02:35,953 --> 00:02:36,957
Whatcha looking at?

61
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,743
Uh, just Pastor Jeffand Mrs. Sparks.

62
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,614
They were out there
the other day, too.

63
00:02:41,698 --> 00:02:43,442
Oh.

64
00:02:43,526 --> 00:02:45,393
How come you don't go with them?

65
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:48,055
They didn't invite me.

66
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:49,579
Ouch.

67
00:02:49,663 --> 00:02:50,797
Rough start to your day.

68
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:55,889
So, the problemthat I'm running into

69
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:57,064
is I can't getthe inner sphere

70
00:02:57,148 --> 00:02:59,589
to remain suspendedin the buffer liquid.

71
00:02:59,673 --> 00:03:01,634
Have you tried wrapping
the sphere in copper wire?

72
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:03,723
I did, but it just slips out.

73
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:06,421
Perhaps we could suspend it
in some sort of sleeve.

74
00:03:06,505 --> 00:03:08,598
That would prevent
lightfrom getting through.

75
00:03:08,682 --> 00:03:10,425
Hmm.

76
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:12,079
I wonder if my thinking
would be more effective

77
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:13,733
if I had a beard to stroke.

78
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:17,033
It's one of the few aspects of
puberty I'm looking forward to.

79
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:19,819
Hey, Tam.

80
00:03:19,904 --> 00:03:22,089
Hey. What if I told you

81
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:24,439
you didn't have to study
for your chemistry test tonight?

82
00:03:24,523 --> 00:03:25,876
Why?

83
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,442
'Cause I found this.

84
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:28,922
Cool.

85
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:31,664
But how do you know
we're gonna get the same test?

86
00:03:31,748 --> 00:03:34,928
I checked... we've been taking
the same ones all year.

87
00:03:35,012 --> 00:03:37,452
And teachers call uslazy?

88
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:38,671
I know.

89
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:40,934
Well, thank you.

90
00:03:41,018 --> 00:03:43,458
Hold on now.
I ain't just givin' it away.

91
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:44,938
How much?

92
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:46,636
Five bucks.

93
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,028
It's worth it.

94
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:49,943
If I get another B,
my mom will kill me.

95
00:03:50,027 --> 00:03:52,206
Hey, I don't just sell tests.

96
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,948
I bring families together.

97
00:03:55,032 --> 00:03:56,950
♪ Take the Lord,
praise the Lord... ♪

98
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:58,561
Get this.

99
00:03:58,645 --> 00:03:59,736
I drove past

100
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,128
the Methodist church
and you know

101
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:02,608
what the sign out front said?

102
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:04,131
What?

103
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:07,918
"Friendship, pirate ship,
try the best ship... worship."

104
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:09,180
Clever.

105
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:11,661
That was our sign last year!
I wrote that!

106
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:13,750
Isn't the most important thing

107
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:16,187
that it might get more people
to go to church?

108
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:18,493
But whoever did it
has the sin of stealing

109
00:04:18,577 --> 00:04:20,923
on their soul now,
so at least there's that.

110
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:23,404
There you go.

111
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:25,631
Oh, um...

112
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:26,632
I saw

113
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:28,547
you and Brenda Sparks

114
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:31,368
out for a walk this mornin'.

115
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:33,944
That's fun.
Yeah.

116
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:35,946
Nice way to start the day.

117
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,903
Yeah. Um...

118
00:04:36,987 --> 00:04:38,035
I'd go with George,

119
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,558
but he's a gym teacher,

120
00:04:39,642 --> 00:04:42,901
and as a group,
they're not much for walkin'.

121
00:04:43,646 --> 00:04:46,557
Well, you keep asking,
maybe he'll come around.

122
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:49,655
Good idea, thank you.

123
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:52,563
It's not just
witty church signs up here.

124
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:57,184
I never thought a sphere
suspended in mineral oil

125
00:04:57,268 --> 00:04:58,751
could be so exciting.

126
00:04:58,835 --> 00:05:00,535
Eight minutes and
it hasn't moved.

127
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:01,754
So far so good.

128
00:05:01,838 --> 00:05:03,843
Oh, boy,
my heart is pounding.

129
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:05,540
I hope I don't turn
into an adrenaline junkie.

130
00:05:05,624 --> 00:05:07,586
What's going
on in there?

131
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,023
This is a prototype
of a solar neutrino detector.

132
00:05:10,107 --> 00:05:11,851
We need to keep
the sphere suspended

133
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:13,679
precisely
in the scintillator.

134
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:14,985
Speaking of scintillating...

135
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:17,284
No.
Sorry.

136
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:19,729
Darn it.

137
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:21,687
Ah, the oil must've
dissolved the adhesive.

138
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:22,732
Well...

139
00:05:22,816 --> 00:05:24,081
ready to hit the road?

140
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:26,692
Please, not yet.
We're so close to cracking this.

141
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:28,999
Just ten more minutes?

142
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,261
Fine.

143
00:05:30,345 --> 00:05:32,959
Oh, boy.
Yes!

144
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:34,874
<i>I wasn't even at that school,</i>

145
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,224
<i>and I was still boosting
its grade point average.</i>

146
00:05:37,308 --> 00:05:38,748
You got biology?

147
00:05:38,832 --> 00:05:40,227
Depends. You got money?

148
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:43,353
Yeah. I got biology.

149
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,063
Perhaps we could create some
sort of a cocoon to suspend it.

150
00:05:50,147 --> 00:05:52,239
Out of wire? Or nylon.

151
00:05:52,323 --> 00:05:54,807
But I wouldn't know
how to weave it around a sphere.

152
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:56,809
I'm not a genius,
but it sounds to me

153
00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:59,290
like what y'all are talking
about is, uh, crochet.

154
00:05:59,374 --> 00:06:01,600
I suppose we are.

155
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:04,990
Because with crochet, you can
make all kinds of shapes.

156
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:06,732
Intriguing.

157
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:09,822
Hell, I even crocheted
a cover for Jolene.

158
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:10,954
I'm sorry?

159
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,651
That's my bowling ball.

160
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,958
She likes to name inanimate
objects... it's odd.

161
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,350
Or whimsically charming.

162
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:19,092
Connie, would you help us
detect solar neutrinos?

163
00:06:19,176 --> 00:06:20,833
Really?

164
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:23,618
You-you-you want me to be
a part of your science thing?

165
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:25,134
Indeed.

166
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:27,797
Well...

167
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:30,060
sure, why not.

168
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:31,235
Excellent.

169
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,436
<i>And just like that,</i>

170
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:37,719
<i>my meemaw had been seduced
by the siren call of science.</i>

171
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:40,113
But before we unravel
the secrets of the universe,

172
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:41,680
I'm gonna hit the John.

173
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:43,544
Oh... of course.

174
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,036
And bless the hands
that prepared it.

175
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,037
Amen.

176
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:52,386
- Amen.
- Amen.

177
00:06:53,072 --> 00:06:54,468
Where is everyone?

178
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,859
Georgie's out and Sheldon's
at the university with Meemaw.

179
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:58,528
A lot of pressure on me
to keep things fun.

180
00:06:58,612 --> 00:07:00,051
Hey, I was thinking

181
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:03,047
after dinner, maybe you and I
could go out for a walk.

182
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,008
Why?

183
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:08,356
Pastor Jeff and Brenda have
been doing it, might be nice.

184
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:10,468
So go with them.

185
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:12,527
They didn't invite her.
She was all upset about it.

186
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,016
Well, you get left out

187
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,659
and I get punished?

188
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:19,022
A walk with your wife
is punishment?

189
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:20,645
You're up, say somethin' fun.

190
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,626
I think Pastor Jeff
and Mrs. Sparks

191
00:07:22,711 --> 00:07:24,499
might be talking about Billy.

192
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:25,936
What's going on with Billy?

193
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:27,895
He's been getting
in trouble at school.

194
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:29,636
How is that fun?

195
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,153
It's gossip. Gossip's fun.

196
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:34,815
Poor thing.

197
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:37,992
Brenda did say he was
having trouble adjusting.

198
00:07:38,076 --> 00:07:40,995
Maybe I should see
if she's doing okay later.

199
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,425
Great idea.
I'm not walking, good job.

200
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:48,220
So what am I
making this thing out of?

201
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:50,004
We were using wire,
but that might be

202
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:51,615
difficult to
crochet with.

203
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:54,224
Oh, please,
I could crochet barbed wire

204
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:55,880
with a chopstick if I had to.

205
00:07:55,964 --> 00:07:57,229
I admire your bravado.

206
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:58,535
In this case,

207
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:00,101
isn't it the feminine,
"bravada"?

208
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:01,755
I've never heard
the term "bravada."

209
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,887
Let's just go
with "chutzpah."

210
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:04,758
What's chutzpah? It's like moxie.

211
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:05,846
Oh, I do like moxie.

212
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,195
I admire your moxie.

213
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,762
However, I believe
that nylon thread

214
00:08:08,846 --> 00:08:10,111
would be the best choice.

215
00:08:10,195 --> 00:08:11,896
True, it's chemically inert
and would allow

216
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,114
more light to pass through.

217
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:14,638
Nylon thread.

218
00:08:14,722 --> 00:08:15,813
Done.

219
00:08:15,897 --> 00:08:17,945
Brava. That one
I know is a word.

220
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:19,207
Can I ask...

221
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,861
why exactly are we looking

222
00:08:20,945 --> 00:08:22,559
for solar neutrinos?

223
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:24,822
Other experiments have only
seen about half the neutrinos

224
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:26,040
coming from the Sun.

225
00:08:26,124 --> 00:08:27,607
And we'd like to
figure out why.

226
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:29,217
And what happens if we do?

227
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,828
They will tell us
what kind of nuclear reactions

228
00:08:30,912 --> 00:08:31,872
are going on there.

229
00:08:31,956 --> 00:08:33,570
In the Sun?

230
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:35,136
Yes.

231
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,964
That's so far... how?

232
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:39,663
Neutrinos are made deep
within the core of the Sun.

233
00:08:39,747 --> 00:08:41,229
They have to go
over a hundred times

234
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,970
the radius of Earth
just to get out.

235
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:44,842
Mm, kind of like
how you can drive

236
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:47,105
all day and still
be in Texas.

237
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:48,802
Exactly, then they have
to travel another

238
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:50,717
93 million miles
just to get here.

239
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:52,023
Huh. Neutrinos are essentially

240
00:08:52,107 --> 00:08:54,591
direct messengers
from the center of the Sun.

241
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:56,723
That's why we're
building the prototype.

242
00:08:56,807 --> 00:08:58,899
And I get to be a part of it?

243
00:08:58,983 --> 00:08:59,857
You do.

244
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:01,075
Damn.

245
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,250
Is there any money in it?

246
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,636
No.
Damn.

247
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:11,825
Hello?

248
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:14,045
Hey, Brenda. It's Mary.

249
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:16,308
Oh. Hey.

250
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:20,348
Hi. I was just checking in,
seeing how you're doing.

251
00:09:21,702 --> 00:09:23,742
How am I doing about what?

252
00:09:25,053 --> 00:09:26,971
Well, I heard that Billy

253
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:29,190
might be having
a tough time at school.

254
00:09:29,274 --> 00:09:31,279
Well, you know what, he'll be
fine, so thanks for calling.

255
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,977
Okay.

256
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:35,719
Um, if there's
anything I can do,

257
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:37,634
or if you ever want to talk...?

258
00:09:37,718 --> 00:09:39,200
Good to know. Anything else?

259
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:41,942
Uh, no, that was it.

260
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:44,372

00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:15,982
Wow. I was gonna guess making

Yeah, Sheldon and Linkletter

322
00:13:19,026 --> 00:13:20,378
asked me to help them out.

323
00:13:20,462 --> 00:13:23,903
Oh. Linkletter's involved.

324
00:13:23,987 --> 00:13:25,252
Oh, well, he's not so bad.

00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:27,298

00:13:27,382 --> 00:13:30,083
Oh, no, no, no.

00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,868
Okay, good.

00:13:31,952 --> 00:13:34,928
I can handle you with a guy
who sells volleyballs,

329
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:38,037
but you with another scientist,
that'd be like

330
00:13:38,122 --> 00:13:39,623

331
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,965
No daggers here.

332
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:44,881
So tell me
about this experiment.

333
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:47,971
Well, I don't know if you know
this, but solar neutrinos

334
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:50,887
are like little messengers
from the center of the Sun.

335
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:52,236
I did know that,

336
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,455
but it's delightful
to hear you say it.

337
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:57,981
Well, enjoy, 'cause that's about
all I remember.

338
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,332
So, what's new by you? Well, let's see...

339
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:06,554
Uh, oh, yesterday I had
my first breakfast burrito.

340
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,121
Mm.

341
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:10,254
Good for you. How was it?

342
00:14:10,338 --> 00:14:14,345
Confusing. I ordinarily have
burritos for lunch or dinner.

343
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,914
I don't know
how to respond to that.

344
00:14:17,998 --> 00:14:19,916
You're working on an experiment

345
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,005
and I'm eating dinner
for breakfast.

346
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:24,398
It's a crazy world.

347
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,404
I've got to get back
to the library.

348
00:14:30,488 --> 00:14:33,277
Oh, but this is so much
more fun than books.

349
00:14:33,361 --> 00:14:35,453
Will I be
seeing you tonight?

350
00:14:35,537 --> 00:14:39,022
Oh, you'll be seeing all of me.

351
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:43,069
I think this might be
my finest work.

352
00:14:43,153 --> 00:14:45,637
And she made my dinner
mittens, so that means a lot.

353
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:47,508
Oh.

354
00:14:47,592 --> 00:14:48,988
I can't thank you enough.

355
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:50,990
Shall we apply
the empirical method?

356
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:53,297
Yes, the empirical method.
Let's apply that.

357
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,085
What now?

358
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,853
I feel like I might've
overstepped my bounds

359
00:15:01,938 --> 00:15:06,286
last night, so I just wanted to
bring you these and apologize.

360
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:08,435
Thank you.

361
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:10,314
And I did mean it.

362
00:15:10,398 --> 00:15:12,055
If you ever need to talk,
I'm here.

363
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:13,970
Appreciate it.

364
00:15:14,054 --> 00:15:15,572
Okay.

365
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:18,967
It's more than Billy.

366
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:24,755
Herschel moved out.

367
00:15:26,153 --> 00:15:29,456
Oh, Brenda, I'm so sorry.

368
00:15:30,548 --> 00:15:32,459
Do you want to come in?

369
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:35,897
Of course.

370
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,783
So what's with the box?

371
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:47,264
The experiment needs
to be in complete darkness to work.

372
00:15:47,348 --> 00:15:49,519
We watch these monitors
for the results.

373
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,012
Okay, all that's left
is to turn on the cameras.

374
00:15:56,096 --> 00:15:57,361
Sheldon, will you
get the lights?

375
00:15:57,445 --> 00:15:59,319
Yes, sir.

376
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:01,713
Is that to make it
more dramatic?

377
00:16:01,797 --> 00:16:04,716
It's so that we can better
see the flashes on the monitor.

378
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,239
But a little drama never hurts.

379
00:16:06,323 --> 00:16:07,719
All right, here we go.

380
00:16:07,803 --> 00:16:10,521
Commencement of the solar
neutrino detector prototype

381
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:13,159
in three, two, one.

382
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:21,515
I don't see anything.

383
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,168
Give it a moment.

384
00:16:30,652 --> 00:16:32,048
Is that it?

385
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:33,136
That's it.

386
00:16:34,482 --> 00:16:36,052
We did it.

387
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:37,531
Phase one is a success.

388
00:16:37,615 --> 00:16:39,055
Congratulations.

389
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:40,360
Wow.

390
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:44,060
Look at those
beautiful neutrinos.

391
00:16:44,144 --> 00:16:45,278
Those aren't neutrinos.

392
00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:46,540
What are you talking about?

393
00:16:46,624 --> 00:16:48,107
That's what we're looking for.

394
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:50,109
That's just radioactivity.

395
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:54,070
Well, then,
when do we find the neutrinos?

396
00:16:54,154 --> 00:16:56,333
We don't.
This is just the prototype.

397
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:57,812
You kidding me?

398
00:16:57,896 --> 00:17:00,293
The actual device needed
would be the size of a building.

399
00:17:00,377 --> 00:17:02,165
And that's 20 to 30 years away.

400
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:04,167
Well, I could be dead by then.

401
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:06,560
You still may have
helped advance science.

402
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:08,171
Unless another team
beats us to it.

403
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:09,555
Yeah.

404
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:12,523
I'm gonna wait in the car.

405
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:15,997
If it helps, in 30 years,
I should still be alive.

406
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:19,791
Boy, you'd think
she'd be happy about that.

407
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,699
Remember, the smart cheater
gets some answers wrong.

408
00:17:31,887 --> 00:17:33,405
I heard I might find you here.

409
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,199
Oh, hey, Mr. Givens.

410
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:39,237
Would you like to explain why
this was on the copy machine?

411
00:17:39,982 --> 00:17:41,552
Anyone could have
left that there.

412
00:17:41,636 --> 00:17:44,199
It's your brother's
and Tam said it was you.

413
00:17:44,943 --> 00:17:46,557
Fine, but I only left it there

414
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:49,160
because you came in
the copy room and I had to hide.

415
00:17:49,948 --> 00:17:51,727
What? When? What?

416
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:53,773
This morning before school.

417
00:17:53,952 --> 00:17:55,653
Uh...

418
00:17:55,737 --> 00:17:57,698
What exactly did you see?

419
00:17:57,782 --> 00:17:59,700
I don't want to talk about it.

420
00:17:59,784 --> 00:18:02,225
Well, I don't want you
talking about it.

421
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:04,096
Well, I don't want
you talking about this.

422
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,668
I don't even know what this is.

423
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:06,846
I don't even know what I saw.

424
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,630
- All right, then.
- All right.
