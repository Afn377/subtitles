1
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:08,365
Oof. Babe?

2
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:10,201
You home?

3
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:18,209
Well, the Speed
Force is definitely fixed

4
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:21,145
because the loft did not
look like this a second ago.

5
00:00:21,214 --> 00:00:23,180
You like it?

6
00:00:23,249 --> 00:00:24,348
I love it.

7
00:00:25,584 --> 00:00:29,019
Like the trip to Maui yesterday

8
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:32,389
and the fresh crepes
this morning from Paris.

9
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,858
You, Barry Allen,

10
00:00:34,927 --> 00:00:39,063
are the most romantic husband ever.

11
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,473
_

12
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:48,772
Satellites say it's just a
small, everyday earthquake.

13
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:52,542
Usually we have to kiss
first to make the ground shake.

15
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:23,407
After Mirror Monarch's brutal attack

16
00:01:23,476 --> 00:01:25,075
on Central City last week,

17
00:01:25,144 --> 00:01:27,211
construction areas
like the one behind me

18
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,945
have popped up all over the city.

19
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:31,415
Volunteers from local businesses

20
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:34,351
and everyday citizens are working hard

21
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,887
to repair the damage
Eva McCulloch left behind.

22
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:40,891
And here is the person
we've been waiting for,

23
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,128
the hero of Central City, the Flash.

24
00:01:44,196 --> 00:01:47,431
An earthquake hit
Central City last night,

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
a city already on edge.

26
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,435
How is morale?

27
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:53,904
Well, the sign says it all:

28
00:01:53,973 --> 00:01:55,572
"Central City Strong."

29
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:57,165
THE FLASH ARRIVES

30
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,677
I let down this city

31
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,780
by failing to prevent Mirror Monarch

32
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:05,750
from tearing our community apart.

33
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:07,617
But I will make it up to you.

34
00:02:07,686 --> 00:02:09,153
I promise.

35
00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:12,256
Together, we're
rebuilding our community,

36
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:15,226
our homes, our lives.

37
00:02:15,294 --> 00:02:17,962
It'll take time, but...

38
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,531
but I believe in this city,

39
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,966
its resilience...

40
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:25,835
most of all, its people.

41
00:02:25,904 --> 00:02:28,439
That's how we'll survive this.

42
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:31,108
Central City Strong.

43
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:33,810
Thank you, Flash.

44
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:39,916
For "The Arielle Atkins Hour,"

45
00:02:39,986 --> 00:02:42,253
this has been Arielle Atkins.

46
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:44,588
Wow, Flash's speech
has me wanting to sign up

47
00:02:44,657 --> 00:02:45,856
for double shifts today.

48
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:47,491
Yeah, he knows what the people need

49
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,959
to hear to get back on our feet.

50
00:02:51,764 --> 00:02:53,397
Yo, this is epic.

51
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,232
I didn't know S.T.A.R.
Labs did volunteer work.

52
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,534
Mm-hmm. Not just us.

53
00:02:57,603 --> 00:02:59,736
Kord Industries is showing
up for their shift in an hour.

54
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:01,071
Hey. You got any more nails?

55
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,472
Oh, yeah. I got your box nail,

56
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:03,707
finishing nail, casing nail,

57
00:03:03,776 --> 00:03:05,309
masonry nail... all the nails.

58
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:08,712
You got a latte in there?

59
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:10,514
'Cause I'm as fried as these wires.

60
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,017
Oh, Runk-adelic, are you
thinking what I'm thinking?

61
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:14,117
- Yeah, we gotta replace...
- Jitters run.

62
00:03:14,186 --> 00:03:15,552
Or Jitters run.

63
00:03:15,621 --> 00:03:17,221
I like Jitters. We should do Jitters.

64
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:19,856
- One latte coming right up.
- Make it a double.

65
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:24,428
You okay?

66
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,363
After our fight with Eva,

67
00:03:26,432 --> 00:03:27,697
I have just been exhausted.

68
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:28,732
And now I've got this headache.

69
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,100
If you need to recharge,

70
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,268
can't you just, like, frost out?

71
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:33,370
No, not out here.

72
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,904
I... you and I know she's reformed,

73
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:36,640
but technically, there's
still a warrant out

74
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,074
for Killer Frost's arrest.

75
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:41,411
Who's that?

76
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:46,016
Iris wants notes
on a "Citizen" article.

77
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:47,551
Kamilla's been spending all her time

78
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,420
photographing the
destruction in the city.

79
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:51,355
It's great that she's so inspired,

80
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:55,125
but now I'm the only one
that can give Iris any feedback.

81
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:57,694
Maybe I'll stay here a little longer.

82
00:03:57,763 --> 00:04:00,264
It sounds like you're avoiding her.

83
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,366
Fine. I'm going.

84
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:15,679
Hey. Got your text.

85
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:17,447
Great. Sorry to drag you away.

86
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:19,349
But I need those notes
on the Mirrorverse article.

87
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:21,418
We need to go to press ASAP.

88
00:04:21,487 --> 00:04:23,420
Online viewership is down 73%,

89
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:24,788
and I think that my article

90
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:26,222
could be what "The Citizen" needs

91
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:27,491
to pull us out of the financial hole

92
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,725
that Mirror-Me put us in.

93
00:04:28,794 --> 00:04:30,594
Ooh. Did you get me a T-shirt?

94
00:04:30,662 --> 00:04:34,665
Yes.

95
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,566
Thanks. Cute.

96
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:38,702
Okay. So stop burying the lede.

97
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:40,904
Tell me what you think. Good, huh?

98
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:45,642
Well, it was really well written.

99
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:47,077
Okay. Come on.

100
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:50,213
Pretend you're my editor. Lay it on me.

101
00:04:50,282 --> 00:04:52,849
It stinks, okay?

102
00:04:55,154 --> 00:04:57,587
This part about the
explosion at McCulloch Tech

103
00:04:57,656 --> 00:04:59,656
is straight out of CCPN's report.

104
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:02,192
This section on Eva's
framing of Sue Dearbon

105
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,794
was already covered to
death by CC News Network.

106
00:05:04,863 --> 00:05:06,997
And was this quote from that Maurice guy

107
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:08,398
even fact-checked?

108
00:05:10,402 --> 00:05:12,569
Okay. Is there anything else?

109
00:05:12,638 --> 00:05:14,104
Yeah.

110
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:15,605
You were in the Mirrorverse the longest

111
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:18,142
and knew Eva the best.

112
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,909
You're the expert.

113
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:22,146
So where's anything
about your experience?

114
00:05:22,214 --> 00:05:23,747
'Cause what's missing from this is you.

115
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:26,350
I'm the reporter, not the story.

116
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:28,218
This time you're both.

117
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,120
Look...

118
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:35,792
There are people out there just like you

119
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:39,330
who wish they hadn't
been a part of this story.

120
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:40,864
But they were.

121
00:05:40,932 --> 00:05:42,632
You're their voice.

122
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:45,602
So try again...

123
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:47,137
for them.

124
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,026
Who the hell are you?

125
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:20,537
I'm the greatest magician of all time,

126
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:22,739
which is why you should
be more than just afraid...

127
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:28,044
You should be terrified.

128
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,184
Boo.

129
00:06:46,465 --> 00:06:49,600
Abracadabra.

130
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,047
Now for my greatest trick yet...

131
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,552
Absolute suffering.

132
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:17,172
I feel like usually I'd be like,

133
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:19,274
"Holy Arthur C. Clarke,"

134
00:07:19,342 --> 00:07:22,177
but it's just so... cute.

135
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:23,844
Mm, don't let it fool you.

136
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:25,346
It may be collectible size,

137
00:07:25,415 --> 00:07:28,649
but this little guy is heavy.

138
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:30,184
Two tons?

139
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:32,487
Boy, that's, like, 20 baby elephants,

140
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:34,222
which is also kinda cute.

141
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,823
I mean, what do you
think this thing's made of?

142
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:38,292
And how does a shed just disappear?

143
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:40,328
None of it makes any sense.

144
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:44,865
Barry, I know this all seems bad but...

145
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:46,834
Chester, this city's
been through hell.

146
00:07:46,903 --> 00:07:48,168
It can't take another emergency.

147
00:07:48,238 --> 00:07:49,804
Not now, not this soon.

148
00:07:49,872 --> 00:07:51,339
We got this, Bar. Don't worry.

149
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:54,141
We just started rebuilding.

150
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,944
I'm not gonna let anything
tear us down again.

151
00:07:57,013 --> 00:08:00,581
Please tell me you boys
found something we can use.

152
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,183
I think I just did.

153
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:04,985
It looks like this whole
crime scene is infected

154
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:07,088
with serious temporal energy.

155
00:08:07,157 --> 00:08:11,859
Like, the kind carbon-dated
43 centuries from now.

156
00:08:11,927 --> 00:08:14,128
As in the future?

157
00:08:14,197 --> 00:08:16,331
Wait, hold on, hold on. Is
thing, like, a time capsule?

158
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,731
Ooh, maybe like a TARDIS.

159
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,000
P-Runk, you picked
a hell of a day to start

160
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,136
your CCPD-consultant internship.

161
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:24,639
Yeah, this is definitely
a time traveler.

162
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:26,507
Oh, yes.

163
00:08:26,576 --> 00:08:28,809
Bar, there's something
you need to see.

164
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:32,946
It's not just a time traveler.

165
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:35,083
He's a guy who has

166
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:38,919
a theatrical flair for killing.

167
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:43,691
Abra Kadabra is back.

168
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,960
Oh. Great.

169
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,429
That explains all the
shakin' and quakin' yesterday.

170
00:08:48,498 --> 00:08:51,399
Ooh, timequakes too?

171
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:52,766
Whoa, okay.

172
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:54,802
So what's this Abra dude's deal?

173
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:57,705
Oh, you know, he's just
your standard time-traveling,

174
00:08:57,774 --> 00:08:59,973
murdering, thieving
64th-century magician

175
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:02,510
who uses imbedded
nanotech and calls it magic.

176
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:04,778
Four years ago, the
Collector's Agency took him

177
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:06,948
to be executed for his crimes.

178
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:08,516
Somehow he escaped.

179
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:10,285
Last time, he was
hell-bent on stealing tech

180
00:09:10,353 --> 00:09:11,619
to build a time machine.

181
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:13,087
This time, he goes out of his way

182
00:09:13,156 --> 00:09:14,522
to kill an innocent person,

183
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:17,024
doesn't steal a thing.

184
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:19,027
Now that's a pretty vicious escalation.

185
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:21,061
And what's that thing
back there got to do with it?

186
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,596
You know, it doesn't matter.

187
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:23,931
Kadabra picked the
wrong day to come back.

188
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:25,533
I'll put out a BOLO right way.

189
00:09:25,601 --> 00:09:27,535
You wanna help me
analyze some of this stuff?

190
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:29,069
- Yeah.
- I'll search the city.

191
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,043
Central City Strong.

192
00:09:40,816 --> 00:09:43,951
When I was inside that other place,

193
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,821
I watched that Mirror version of me

194
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,859
spend time with my wife.

195
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:55,029
They ate meals together,
talked about their day.

196
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:58,433
I remember screaming, "That's not me!"

197
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:00,200
But I was helpless.

198
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:01,936
Barry! That's not me!

199
00:10:02,004 --> 00:10:03,404
That's not me!

200
00:10:03,473 --> 00:10:05,406
I thought everything would be okay

201
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:06,741
once I was back.

202
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:07,775
It's not.

203
00:10:07,843 --> 00:10:11,779
I'm trying so hard

204
00:10:11,847 --> 00:10:13,448
to get back to normal.

205
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:15,984
I'm trying so hard to be fine.

206
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:19,020
But the truth is that
things are not normal

207
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:20,821
and I am not fine.

208
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,291
And I won't be

209
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,193
for a long time.

210
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:28,363
Thank you so much
for coming and listening.

211
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:31,865
Steven. Alice.

212
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:33,000
Thank you for agreeing

213
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:34,168
to do this interview with me.

214
00:10:34,237 --> 00:10:35,469
Are you sure I'm not intruding?

215
00:10:35,538 --> 00:10:36,537
Of course not.

216
00:10:36,606 --> 00:10:38,406
We're all in this together.

217
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:39,907
Central City Strong.

218
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:41,409
Yeah, um...

219
00:10:41,477 --> 00:10:43,711
Yeah.

220
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:46,880
Um, are you all right?

221
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:48,582
You seem upset.

222
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:49,584
Me? No.

223
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:52,387
I'm fine. I'm fine.

224
00:10:52,455 --> 00:10:55,656
Were you abducted as well?

225
00:10:58,495 --> 00:11:01,162
You know, if you ever
wanna sit in with the group...

226
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:02,763
No, I... I'm fine. Thank you.

227
00:11:02,832 --> 00:11:04,599
You don't seem like it.

228
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,534
Yeah, I just...

229
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:08,902
I have a deadline for another article.

230
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:11,339
Um, do you mind if we reschedule?

231
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:12,807
Sure. No problem.

232
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,342
Thanks.

233
00:11:22,885 --> 00:11:25,219
We could do release-date order...

234
00:11:25,288 --> 00:11:28,356
Or machete order.

235
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:31,192
Prequels after "Empire"?

236
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:32,760
You're a wild man, and I love it.

237
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:35,095
"Then the Jedi Counsel has spoken."

238
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:37,298
"It has."

239
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:39,032
Getting anything on
your scans over there?

240
00:11:40,936 --> 00:11:43,037
No.

241
00:11:43,106 --> 00:11:44,905
I think it might be
time for a Jitters run.

242
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:46,107
Well, thank God,

243
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:47,941
'cause Chester P is running on E.

244
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,110
Holy cappuccino.

245
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:51,812
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

246
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:53,981
That's the same temporal
scan from this morning,

247
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:55,650
only now there's a second one downtown.

248
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:57,050
Which means...

249
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:58,386
That's where Kadabra's headed next.

250
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:04,725
Two is always deadlier than one.

251
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:16,304
Flash, I knew it was
just a matter of time.

252
00:12:16,372 --> 00:12:17,971
Bad timing for you, Kadabra.

253
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,275
Yeah, those would be
nanotech nullifying cuffs,

254
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:23,611
so no hocus-pocus this time.

255
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,779
Hey, what's up with all your new toys?

256
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:28,549
A magician never reveals his secrets.

257
00:12:28,618 --> 00:12:30,818
I see you're finally Mecha-Vibe.

258
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:32,119
Mecha-Vibe?

259
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:33,721
I know he did not just name me.

260
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:35,890
Oh, I know more than just your name.

261
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,791
I've seen your future.

262
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,927
It's over. You've lost.

263
00:12:39,996 --> 00:12:41,362
Have I?

264
00:12:41,431 --> 00:12:44,498
Seems you've forgotten
the art of misdirection.

265
00:12:46,102 --> 00:12:48,769
- Ha.
- Oh, shoot.

266
00:12:51,574 --> 00:12:53,307
You know what?

267
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:56,009
I'm doing you a favor
by killing you now, Flash.

268
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,313
This way, you'll never
have to face the wrath

269
00:12:59,382 --> 00:13:02,182
of the Chronarch.

270
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:04,485
Alas, you can't run forever.

271
00:13:09,258 --> 00:13:12,693
What's that you were
saying the art of misdirection?

272
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:25,382
Look at me. I'm A.R.G.U.S.

273
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:27,551
I'm gonna let two young, handsome devils

274
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,686
do all the work while
I reap all the benefits,

275
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:31,221
and I'm gonna pick up the obelisks.

276
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,723
That doesn't bug you?

277
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,858
Kadabra's caught. The job's finished.

278
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:36,760
You really wanna argue
over who gets credit?

279
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:38,862
Yes!

280
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,266
No.

281
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,001
I just wanna know what the plan is.

282
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,503
All right. Knock yourself out.

283
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:47,471
I gotta do something important for Iris.

284
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:52,810
Hey, uh, hold up there, chief.

285
00:13:54,547 --> 00:13:56,613
My classification is

286
00:13:56,682 --> 00:13:59,317
director of technology
and science for A.R.G.U.S.

287
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:01,485
I have never held the rank of chief.

288
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:02,819
Okay.

289
00:14:02,888 --> 00:14:04,688
Hey, I just wanna know what your plan is

290
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:06,790
for keeping David
Copperfield here contained.

291
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:09,260
David Copperfield is not currently

292
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:10,894
under A.R.G.U.S.'s custody.

293
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:12,296
Are you for real right now?

294
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:14,231
If you're asking if I'm a hologram,

295
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,233
I can neither confirm nor deny

296
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:18,302
A.R.G.U.S.'s use of such tactics.

297
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:26,810
Oh, you just missed
Lieutenant Literal.

298
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,579
Where were you? Hiding from A.R.G.U.S.?

299
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:30,181
No. A.R.G.U.S. and I are cool.

300
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:31,815
They know I'm innocent.

301
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:33,083
I was trying to get rid
of this stupid headache.

302
00:14:33,152 --> 00:14:36,187
But look what I liberated

303
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:38,122
from one of the transport guards.

304
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:39,456
Ice, ice, bandit. What is it?

305
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:41,092
I don't know.

306
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,826
But it was on Abra Kadabra
when they took him down.

307
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:44,628
Maybe it has something
to do with the obelisk?

308
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:46,563
- Yeah, maybe.
- Uh-uh!

309
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:48,699
Before you nerd out completely,

310
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:50,934
I need a favor.

311
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:57,241
What's wrong with me?

312
00:14:59,878 --> 00:15:02,113
So much.

313
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:05,549
I'm kidding. You're fine.

314
00:15:05,618 --> 00:15:08,352
Every dark-matter reading
I'm seeing is completely normal.

315
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:09,720
What does Caitlin have to say?

316
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:11,322
She says it's "just a headache."

317
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:13,156
Hmm. She's probably right.

318
00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:14,325
I told you so.

319
00:15:14,394 --> 00:15:15,492
I know something is off.

320
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:16,960
We can't find anything.

321
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,395
Well, then look somewhere else!

322
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:20,364
I don't know what
else you want me to do!

323
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:22,633
Sorry. I was yelling at Caity.

324
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:24,034
Yeah, okay.

325
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:25,502
I'm gonna let you two work this out.

326
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:27,070
Chester and I are gonna break open

327
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:31,007
Abra Kadabra's mysterious tech cuff.

328
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:46,089
Missing those fancy trophies?

329
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:47,558
What's that?

330
00:15:47,627 --> 00:15:49,025
You're still looking for the third one?

331
00:15:49,094 --> 00:15:50,561
It's already here.

332
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,696
We picked it up last week.

333
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:55,899
Hey. Keep it moving, Houdini.

334
00:15:57,637 --> 00:15:58,702
What are you trying to pull?

335
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:02,106
Nothing.

336
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:03,240
It's already done.

337
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:10,948
Access granted.

338
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:23,894
And then there were three.

339
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:34,404
Hey.

340
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:35,539
- Hey.
- Save your work.

341
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:37,140
You can finish writing

342
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:39,810
in the beach villa I just
rented us in Monaco.

343
00:16:44,283 --> 00:16:45,883
You mean leave right now?

344
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:46,950
Yeah.

345
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:48,619
For a romantic villa.

346
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:49,753
In Monaco.

347
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:50,921
Barry.

348
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:52,322
Look... you're working.

349
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:53,824
- I get that that's important.
- Yeah.

350
00:16:53,892 --> 00:16:55,592
But you were just staring

351
00:16:55,661 --> 00:16:57,294
at a blank screen when I...

352
00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:58,795
- Fa-thwoomed in?
- Yeah.

353
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:01,097
And you know what's
great when you're stuck?

354
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,600
Clearing your head in Monaco.

355
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:05,436
Cool breeze,

356
00:17:05,505 --> 00:17:07,771
waves crashing on the white sand.

357
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,340
Barry, we have
traveled the globe nonstop

358
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:12,142
all this past week.

359
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:13,977
Yeah, 'cause you deserve the best.

360
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:16,379
Are you okay?

361
00:17:16,448 --> 00:17:18,148
Yeah, I'm fine.

362
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:19,616
I'm just... I'm trying to
sweep my wife off her feet

363
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:20,684
for a romantic getaway.

364
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:23,254
Which I appreciate, but...

365
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:25,155
Iris, will you please just
let me make this up to you?

366
00:17:25,223 --> 00:17:26,257
Please?

367
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:30,794
I'm sorry. I'm just...

368
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:31,929
all right, you know what? No.

369
00:17:31,997 --> 00:17:34,598
I'll think of something else.

370
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,537
Yeah. Um, yes.

371
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:42,305
Yeah. Let's go.

372
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,774
- Really?
- Yeah.

373
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:46,944
Um, yeah. Zoop me to paradise.

374
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:49,145
Don't you wanna pack your laptop?

375
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:51,047
Uh, no. You know what?

376
00:17:51,116 --> 00:17:52,515
I need to take a break. You're right.

377
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:55,185
Surf and sand sounds perfect right now.

378
00:17:58,824 --> 00:18:00,223
Kadabra's just escaped custody.

379
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:01,892
He's loose somewhere in A.R.G.U.S.

380
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:04,361
Go.

381
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:06,363
Go.

382
00:18:16,074 --> 00:18:17,874
Stand down.

383
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:19,242
This is your last chance.

384
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:20,744
Flash being ruthless.

385
00:18:20,813 --> 00:18:22,012
I like it.

386
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:26,083
As much as I enjoy the
stink of desperation on you,

387
00:18:26,151 --> 00:18:27,751
I'm afraid you're too late.

388
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,754
You are trapped in a
constrictive metallic halo.

389
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:33,256
The more you try to
escape, the tighter it gets.

390
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:36,159
So please try to escape.

391
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:38,061
The last time we met,

392
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,030
you begged me to find

393
00:18:40,098 --> 00:18:42,599
a glimmer of light in myself.

394
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:44,868
Well, I found that light,

395
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:46,603
that hope.

396
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:50,107
And then you stole it from me.

397
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:52,275
Now I'm going to take
something from you.

398
00:18:52,344 --> 00:18:53,744
I don't know what
you're talking about.

399
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:56,714
Let me make it crystal
clear for you, Flash.

400
00:18:56,782 --> 00:18:58,481
You cannot defeat a man

401
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,284
who has lost everything.

402
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:09,660
What are you doing?

403
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:12,663
Creating a masterpiece.

404
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:32,215
And now for my last trick.

405
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:37,153
I'm going to make your whole city

406
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:38,789
disappear.

407
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:55,644
Do we have eyes on Kadabra?

408
00:19:55,713 --> 00:19:57,713
Uh, yes and no.

409
00:19:57,782 --> 00:19:59,114
He's teleporting all over the city

410
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:00,182
with that obelisk ball thing.

411
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,282
I'm scanning it.

412
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:02,283
We're picking up readings

413
00:20:02,352 --> 00:20:04,052
of antimatter energy.

414
00:20:04,182 --> 00:20:05,508
ANTIMATTER CHARGE

415
00:20:06,857 --> 00:20:09,525
He created an antimatter bomb.

416
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:12,194
That kind of power, it
could take out another Earth.

417
00:20:12,262 --> 00:20:13,662
- Or another universe.
- Wait, what?

418
00:20:13,731 --> 00:20:15,330
Are we about to have Crisis Part Two?

419
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:17,032
No, no.

420
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:18,634
There's not enough
antimatter energy for that,

421
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:20,501
thank the sequel Gods,

422
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,671
but the core is roughly
the size of a baseball.

423
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,340
A baseball?

424
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:26,875
Barry, a trace amount
nearly took out your leg.

425
00:20:26,944 --> 00:20:28,877
Is it enough to destroy the city?

426
00:20:28,946 --> 00:20:31,013
I'd say there's exactly enough.

427
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:32,380
Abra said his last trick

428
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:36,117
was to make the whole city disappear.

429
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:39,054
Destroying Central
City must be his plan.

430
00:20:39,122 --> 00:20:41,223
- But why now?
- I don't know, but guys?

431
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,026
Every time he teleports, that
bomb gains kinetic energy.

432
00:20:44,094 --> 00:20:45,894
I think he's charging it.

433
00:20:45,963 --> 00:20:47,129
And if I'm reading this right,

434
00:20:47,197 --> 00:20:49,230
this bomb's already at 47%.

435
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:51,333
At this rate, it'll be fully
charged within the hour.

436
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:52,834
Okay. What do we do?

437
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:54,402
There's gotta be a
way to disarm it, right?

438
00:20:54,472 --> 00:20:56,271
I could use one of
my Atlantean plug-ins

439
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,674
to analyze the bomb's outer
hull, determine its density,

440
00:20:58,742 --> 00:21:00,876
see if you can phase
through its surface and...

441
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:03,745
Disarm it.

442
00:21:03,814 --> 00:21:05,613
That's not your happy face.

443
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:10,285
The bomb is made of the same material

444
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,220
as the obelisks.

445
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:13,555
Pure valorium.

446
00:21:13,623 --> 00:21:16,624
A Nth metal alloy. Not good.

447
00:21:16,694 --> 00:21:19,461
It's impenetrable to anything
but the antimatter itself.

448
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,964
Which means you can't
access the core and disarm it.

449
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:23,698
So no phasing.

450
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:26,367
Even if could figure out
a way to catch Kadabra,

451
00:21:26,436 --> 00:21:28,704
his teleportation pattern
is completely randomized.

452
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:32,007
So there's no way to catch
him until he stops moving

453
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:33,575
and detonates the bomb.

454
00:21:35,312 --> 00:21:36,912
I should've known
Kadabra was up to something

455
00:21:36,981 --> 00:21:39,414
when we caught him so easily.

456
00:21:39,483 --> 00:21:42,183
He wanted to be in A.R.G.U.S.

457
00:21:42,252 --> 00:21:46,088
We helped him get the
last piece of that weapon.

458
00:21:46,156 --> 00:21:47,622
I just let it happen.

459
00:21:47,691 --> 00:21:49,457
Barry, it's gonna be okay.

460
00:21:49,526 --> 00:21:51,593
How? He has antimatter,

461
00:21:51,662 --> 00:21:53,628
the most dangerous
substance in existence.

462
00:21:53,697 --> 00:21:55,530
And now, if we can't
figure something out,

463
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:58,500
the entire city, millions
of lives, will be lost

464
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:00,302
because I got tricked...

465
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,003
again.

466
00:22:18,488 --> 00:22:20,822
Hey.

467
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,323
You okay?

468
00:22:22,392 --> 00:22:26,328
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just...

469
00:22:26,396 --> 00:22:28,563
struggling with everything lately.

470
00:22:31,635 --> 00:22:34,235
I tried to find you

471
00:22:34,304 --> 00:22:36,304
when Cisco told me what happened.

472
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:40,642
What did you mean when
you said that you were

473
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,145
tricked again?

474
00:22:43,213 --> 00:22:44,479
From the very first moment

475
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:46,181
that imposter walked into our home,

476
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:48,149
I should've seen it.

477
00:22:48,218 --> 00:22:50,952
I should've known that she wasn't you.

478
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:56,691
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

479
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,395
What happened with
Mirror Iris is not your fault.

480
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:02,364
Then whose fault was it?

481
00:23:02,432 --> 00:23:05,233
I'm the one that didn't realize
I was living with a stranger.

482
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:08,203
And if I had, not only could we
have brought you back sooner,

483
00:23:08,272 --> 00:23:10,371
maybe we could've stopped
Eva before she attacked,

484
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,141
and the whole city wouldn't
be suffering right now.

485
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,245
When we got married, I
promised to always be by your side.

486
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:19,815
And I wasn't.

487
00:23:19,883 --> 00:23:21,984
And I know it's stupid to think

488
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:24,853
if I buy you enough flowers

489
00:23:24,922 --> 00:23:26,321
or make you the perfect dessert,

490
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,756
that's gonna make up for what I did,

491
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:30,726
'cause it won't, but...

492
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:33,361
honestly, I don't know what else to do.

493
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,863
Barry, you don't have to do anything.

494
00:23:35,932 --> 00:23:37,532
You've got me.

495
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:39,735
And I'm never gonna leave.

496
00:23:39,803 --> 00:23:43,038
And I need you to hear me on this, okay?

497
00:23:43,107 --> 00:23:46,307
Something terrible happened to you,

498
00:23:46,376 --> 00:23:47,675
not because of you.

499
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:49,011
And that kind of trauma,

500
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,978
that doesn't go away in a day or a week.

501
00:23:51,048 --> 00:23:53,381
You have to...

502
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,416
Face it.

503
00:23:57,888 --> 00:24:00,656
Mirror Iris took the best part of you,

504
00:24:00,724 --> 00:24:04,559
your heart, and she used
it as a weapon against you.

505
00:24:04,628 --> 00:24:06,728
She lied to you.

506
00:24:06,797 --> 00:24:08,930
Being emotionally manipulated

507
00:24:08,998 --> 00:24:12,567
by someone everything in
your being tells you to trust?

508
00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:15,871
That is not your fault.

509
00:24:18,942 --> 00:24:22,410
Every time I think I couldn't
possibly love you more...

510
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:32,187
You have a family, friends,
people that you care about.

511
00:24:33,657 --> 00:24:35,123
Somewhere inside of you,

512
00:24:35,192 --> 00:24:38,526
there must be a
glimmer of light, of hope.

513
00:24:38,595 --> 00:24:40,361
Well, I found that light,

514
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,363
that hope.

515
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:44,532
And then you stole it from me.

516
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:45,967
What?

517
00:24:46,036 --> 00:24:48,403
I know why Abra's doing this.

518
00:24:51,341 --> 00:24:53,641
This is what we found

519
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:57,245
embedded inside Abra's
annoyingly secure tech cuff.

520
00:24:57,314 --> 00:24:58,980
It's a Martian memory restorer.

521
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:00,882
It helps people get their
pre-Crisis memories back

522
00:25:00,951 --> 00:25:02,083
with a single touch.

523
00:25:02,152 --> 00:25:03,218
How do you know that?

524
00:25:03,286 --> 00:25:04,619
'Cause Cisco designed it.

525
00:25:04,688 --> 00:25:07,089
Whoa. But why?

526
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:10,325
So Laurel Lance and Mia Queen...

527
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,362
Okay, you know what? It's not important.

528
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:15,964
The important thing is

529
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:19,968
I think Kadabra stole
the MMR in the future,

530
00:25:20,037 --> 00:25:22,003
and something in those
pre-Crisis memories

531
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:23,538
brought him here.

532
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:24,706
So the reason he
wants to blow up the city

533
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:26,007
could be in there.

534
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:27,142
Even if it is, it doesn't matter.

535
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,776
We don't have time to find it.

536
00:25:28,845 --> 00:25:30,612
I mean, the human brain
is essentially capable

537
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,613
of storing trillions of
bytes of memories.

538
00:25:32,682 --> 00:25:34,649
It would take us years
to find the one we need.

539
00:25:34,718 --> 00:25:36,151
No, it won't.

540
00:25:37,854 --> 00:25:39,821
I know how to stop Abra.

541
00:25:44,787 --> 00:25:46,420
Flash, Kadabra
stopped at Tagaloa Plaza.

542
00:25:52,702 --> 00:25:54,968
Perfect timing, Flash.

543
00:25:55,037 --> 00:25:56,570
You're just in time to witness

544
00:25:56,639 --> 00:26:00,207
the complete
annihilation of Central City.

545
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:02,510
And you'll finally
understand what it's like

546
00:26:02,578 --> 00:26:04,545
when everything you love dies.

547
00:26:04,614 --> 00:26:06,379
You were right, Kadabra.

548
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:08,448
We can't defeat you,

549
00:26:08,518 --> 00:26:10,685
which is why I'm not gonna try.

550
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,625
What happens if this doesn't work?

551
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:19,360
Then it's game over.

552
00:26:21,196 --> 00:26:23,063
Trying to pull a trick of your own.

553
00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:24,264
I wouldn't.

554
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,800
Your 21st-century brain

555
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:27,034
comes in a distant second

556
00:26:27,103 --> 00:26:29,236
to my 64th-century intellect.

557
00:26:29,305 --> 00:26:31,071
No, no tricks.

558
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,607
Just listen.

559
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,744
I know why you're doing this.

560
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:38,579
I know why you're hurting.

561
00:26:38,648 --> 00:26:42,182
You don't know a damn thing about me.

562
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:44,084
Yes, I do! Yes, I do!

563
00:26:44,153 --> 00:26:46,854
I also know killing innocent
people isn't the answer.

564
00:26:46,923 --> 00:26:48,956
And it's not gonna change anything.

565
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:52,092
Destruction is the
ultimate catalyst for change.

566
00:26:52,161 --> 00:26:54,094
See, people in my
century understand that.

567
00:26:54,163 --> 00:26:56,697
You may be from the future,

568
00:26:56,766 --> 00:26:58,766
but the reason that you're here...

569
00:26:58,835 --> 00:27:00,700
you're trying to change the past.

570
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,269
No.

571
00:27:02,338 --> 00:27:04,037
Leave that alone.

572
00:27:12,148 --> 00:27:14,682
This is your family
from another timeline.

573
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,417
Only they're gone now, aren't they?

574
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,621
13 months ago, I started having dreams

575
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,757
of a life I never lived,

576
00:27:22,825 --> 00:27:24,091
one where I was so...

577
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,929
Happy.

578
00:27:28,998 --> 00:27:31,131
I had to know what was causing them.

579
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
I ran every test on myself possible

580
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:35,869
using 64th-century technology.

581
00:27:35,938 --> 00:27:37,838
What I found was that, somehow,

582
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:39,573
I'd experienced a sudden increase

583
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:41,775
in my somatic memory cells.

584
00:27:41,844 --> 00:27:44,344
Your memories were expanding.

585
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:48,148
More backwards 21st-century thinking.

586
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:50,083
I'd been exposed

587
00:27:50,152 --> 00:27:52,319
to neuro-temporal displacement,

588
00:27:52,388 --> 00:27:55,255
the kind that's created when speedsters

589
00:27:55,324 --> 00:27:57,124
disrupt time.

590
00:27:57,193 --> 00:28:00,360
With my clue for the cause,

591
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,529
it led me to the Flash Museum.

592
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:07,635
You're obsessed with the future, Flash.

593
00:28:07,703 --> 00:28:10,471
Not now, but...

594
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,906
oh, you will be.

595
00:28:12,975 --> 00:28:14,908
I found so many interesting things there

596
00:28:14,977 --> 00:28:16,510
including, to my surprise,

597
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:20,681
Cisco Ramon's archaic memory device.

598
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,683
It was damaged beyond
repair. I fixed it easily.

599
00:28:22,752 --> 00:28:24,484
Ugh. This guy sucks.

600
00:28:24,553 --> 00:28:26,553
You used it on yourself,

601
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,489
and it gave you those memories back.

602
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:30,690
From a time before everything changed.

603
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:33,326
With my memories restored,

604
00:28:33,395 --> 00:28:36,730
I had proof that the
family from my dreams,

605
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,699
a wife and son that I never knew existed

606
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:41,635
were real.

607
00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:45,239
They were erased from existence

608
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:48,308
by what you did.

609
00:28:48,377 --> 00:28:50,377
You were supposed to vanish

610
00:28:50,446 --> 00:28:52,713
in your Crisis, Flash, not them!

611
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,985
But when you didn't, my future changed.

612
00:28:58,053 --> 00:29:00,587
They ceased to exist,
and I lost everything.

613
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,155
Just like you will now!

614
00:29:02,224 --> 00:29:03,490
Wait!

615
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,495
Kadabra's weapon is 97% charged.

616
00:29:08,564 --> 00:29:09,729
We have less than 90 seconds.

617
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:11,198
You can do this, Barry.

618
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:15,903
Crisis destroyed countless lives.

619
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:18,906
And yes, some of us survived,

620
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:21,541
and that's not fair.

621
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,944
Now we have to carry on

622
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,480
for those who didn't.

623
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:29,717
I lost someone too.

624
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:31,919
He was like a brother to me.

625
00:29:31,988 --> 00:29:35,723
And ever since, I've
tried to honor his sacrifice.

626
00:29:37,126 --> 00:29:40,060
You can do the same for your family.

627
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,463
I'm betting you already tried to go back

628
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:46,901
before Crisis started,
and you couldn't, right?

629
00:29:46,969 --> 00:29:48,702
That's because that past

630
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:52,039
is from a multi-versal
world that no longer exists.

631
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:56,409
Killing me won't reset the timeline.

632
00:29:56,478 --> 00:29:58,145
That future is gone.

633
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,780
Liar! I will bring them back.

634
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:02,750
And if I can't, then I'll
take everything from you

635
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,618
the way I lost everything.

636
00:30:04,687 --> 00:30:06,120
My pain is yours.

637
00:30:06,188 --> 00:30:08,789
That's why you wanna destroy the city.

638
00:30:08,858 --> 00:30:12,159
So you can make people suffer like you.

639
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:15,028
Because you already
know killing me won't work.

640
00:30:15,097 --> 00:30:16,363
Shut up!

641
00:30:16,432 --> 00:30:17,931
You've run all the calculations.

642
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You can't comprehend what I've done!

643
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:22,937
Yes, I can. I am a scientist too.

644
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:25,439
So tell me:

645
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:29,209
what are the odds that doing
this will bring them back?

646
00:30:31,948 --> 00:30:34,181
Barry, it's about to explode.

647
00:30:41,557 --> 00:30:43,958
I haven't run a calculation
on the timeline yet

648
00:30:44,026 --> 00:30:47,027
to where they return.

649
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:49,162
How would they feel

650
00:30:49,231 --> 00:30:51,664
knowing you annihilated

651
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:54,801
an entire city in their name?

652
00:30:57,873 --> 00:31:00,673
Making other people hurt

653
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:03,610
won't erase your suffering.

654
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:07,347
The only way for you to heal

655
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:09,316
is to face your trauma.

656
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,444
He did it.

657
00:31:37,513 --> 00:31:38,946
Without throwing a single punch.

658
00:31:39,014 --> 00:31:42,015
Yeah, the Flash
doesn't need big fists.

659
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:43,517
He's got a big heart.

660
00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:00,467
Luca.

661
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,571
That was my son.

662
00:32:06,242 --> 00:32:09,509
Amélie, my wife.

663
00:32:09,578 --> 00:32:11,611
And your friend?

664
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,213
His name was Oliver.

665
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:17,350
My name's Philippe.

666
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:24,224
What am I supposed to do now?

667
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:26,493
I can't go on without them.

668
00:32:26,561 --> 00:32:29,096
The people we love never leave us.

669
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:35,435
Let that love help you find
hope again in this world.

670
00:32:35,504 --> 00:32:38,772
I don't get it.

671
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,440
We're mortal enemies in the future.

672
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:42,742
Why are you doing this?

673
00:32:42,811 --> 00:32:45,078
So the next time we meet,

674
00:32:45,147 --> 00:32:47,314
maybe we won't be.

675
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,558
Fair enough.

676
00:33:02,298 --> 00:33:03,897
This isn't me.

677
00:33:06,035 --> 00:33:07,735
I'm picking up enough seismic activity

678
00:33:07,803 --> 00:33:09,303
to rattle us back to the Stone Age.

679
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:11,571
Detecting a massive biosignature.

680
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,140
Barry, whatever's
causing these tremors,

681
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,407
it's headed right towards you.

682
00:33:22,451 --> 00:33:23,984
Barry!

683
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:35,062
Barry, get up.

684
00:33:35,131 --> 00:33:37,464
Get up, Barry.

685
00:33:40,903 --> 00:33:43,904
You are an ugly one.

686
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,576
I've got this, Flash.

687
00:33:51,046 --> 00:33:53,213
Stand down, beautiful.

688
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:55,783
Or I'll use every ounce
of this antimatter bomb

689
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:57,351
to blow you to kingdom come.

690
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:16,069
That's impossible.

691
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:25,278
Fine. See how you like this trick.

692
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,789
Philippe?

693
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:44,898
What have you done?!

694
00:35:05,654 --> 00:35:07,754
Barry!

695
00:35:07,823 --> 00:35:09,356
Respiratory distress,
elevated blood pressure.

696
00:35:09,425 --> 00:35:10,624
He's crashing.

697
00:35:36,931 --> 00:35:38,931
Philippe was trying to heal,

698
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,702
just like the rest of us.

699
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,871
This isn't right.

700
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:46,906
He died a hero.

701
00:35:46,974 --> 00:35:48,608
That means something.

702
00:35:48,676 --> 00:35:50,610
What was that thing anyway?

703
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:52,445
Death itself, maybe.

704
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,182
Whatever it was,

705
00:35:57,251 --> 00:35:59,919
it absorbed the full power
of an antimatter bomb.

706
00:35:59,987 --> 00:36:01,154
That means it's...

707
00:36:01,223 --> 00:36:04,190
Unstoppable?

708
00:36:06,227 --> 00:36:08,828
But hey. You're, uh...

709
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:10,029
you're okay, right?

710
00:36:10,098 --> 00:36:12,164
Yeah, yeah.

711
00:36:12,233 --> 00:36:13,700
Since we rebooted the Speed Force,

712
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,334
I'm faster than ever.

713
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:16,369
So is my speed healing.

714
00:36:16,438 --> 00:36:18,170
- Thank goodness.
- Great.

715
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:21,106
The brass are dumping a liaison

716
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:23,376
from the Governor's Police
Compliance Commission

717
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:24,577
in my lap.

718
00:36:24,646 --> 00:36:26,813
I gotta go figure out

719
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:29,882
how to explain all this to her.

720
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:31,484
Well, I have lots of meta-clients

721
00:36:31,553 --> 00:36:32,985
that need my legal expertise.

722
00:36:33,054 --> 00:36:35,855
How about I drop you off at the station?

723
00:36:42,029 --> 00:36:43,463
So what do we do now?

724
00:36:43,532 --> 00:36:45,397
Same thing we always do.

725
00:36:45,466 --> 00:36:47,934
Get to work stopping that
thing before it kills again.

726
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,139
Allegra.

727
00:36:57,011 --> 00:36:59,145
What you said about my article?

728
00:36:59,213 --> 00:37:02,648
If you're gonna say I
came off kinda harsh,

729
00:37:02,717 --> 00:37:04,250
you're not the first.

730
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:07,953
I'm glad you told me
what I needed to hear.

731
00:37:08,022 --> 00:37:11,391
But it's still hard to
take from an intern.

732
00:37:13,127 --> 00:37:14,627
Which is why I'm
making you a staff writer.

733
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:17,964
Wait. You're what?

734
00:37:18,032 --> 00:37:20,332
Congratulations. You earned it.

735
00:37:20,402 --> 00:37:23,335
Thanks, boss.

736
00:37:27,308 --> 00:37:29,542
You're amazing.

737
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:31,377
And you helped me
get through to Philippe,

738
00:37:31,446 --> 00:37:32,812
and that saved the city.

739
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:35,848
It's called teamwork.

740
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:38,184
We're Barry and Iris.

741
00:37:38,252 --> 00:37:41,687
It's the strongest superpower there is.

742
00:37:41,756 --> 00:37:42,955
So I was thinking tonight,

743
00:37:43,024 --> 00:37:45,124
maybe we just go home,

744
00:37:45,192 --> 00:37:46,959
have a normal dinner,

745
00:37:47,028 --> 00:37:49,028
maybe eat a frozen pizza on the couch?

746
00:37:49,097 --> 00:37:51,063
Sounds perfect.

747
00:37:51,132 --> 00:37:52,965
But?

748
00:37:53,034 --> 00:37:53,966
Nothing.

749
00:37:54,035 --> 00:37:55,535
I just... I was thinking

750
00:37:55,604 --> 00:37:57,803
of something I have to do tomorrow.

751
00:37:57,872 --> 00:38:00,139
Come on. Let's go.

752
00:38:05,447 --> 00:38:06,979
Hi.

753
00:38:12,053 --> 00:38:14,720
I am no stranger to trauma.

754
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:18,357
But when Eva McCulloch
threatened our city,

755
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:21,627
I was taken against my will

756
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,997
to a...

757
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:26,899
terrifying place,

758
00:38:26,968 --> 00:38:30,036
a place that you all know.

759
00:38:30,104 --> 00:38:33,906
Somewhere filled with loneliness

760
00:38:33,975 --> 00:38:36,776
and dread.

761
00:38:36,844 --> 00:38:39,078
The same dread that you all felt too.

762
00:38:39,146 --> 00:38:42,715
And that is where I spent

763
00:38:42,784 --> 00:38:44,617
the next three months.

764
00:38:46,788 --> 00:38:49,889
Three months where I
couldn't be with my loved ones.

765
00:38:49,957 --> 00:38:52,091
And, yes,

766
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,428
I feel...

767
00:38:55,497 --> 00:38:57,196
angry.

768
00:38:57,264 --> 00:39:01,133
And I feel sorry for myself.

769
00:39:01,202 --> 00:39:04,170
And I hate that I feel
both of those things.

770
00:39:04,238 --> 00:39:06,205
And I wish that all of that

771
00:39:06,273 --> 00:39:07,840
was yesterday's pain,

772
00:39:07,909 --> 00:39:11,744
and that today, I could
feel healed and whole.

773
00:39:11,813 --> 00:39:15,514
But I now understand that

774
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:20,386
I can't heal if I don't
allow myself permission

775
00:39:20,454 --> 00:39:22,789
to feel what I'm feeling.

776
00:39:28,596 --> 00:39:31,764
What happened to us

777
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:35,668
was not right.

778
00:39:35,737 --> 00:39:39,071
And...

779
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,441
if you are hurting, if you feel angry,

780
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,844
if the constant presence
of those emotions

781
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:48,781
is exhausting you,

782
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:52,618
you are not alone.

783
00:39:52,687 --> 00:39:54,754
I am with you.

784
00:39:54,822 --> 00:39:57,256
You know, my dad once said that,

785
00:39:57,324 --> 00:40:00,325
"There is as much beauty
in this life as there is pain.

786
00:40:00,394 --> 00:40:04,263
You just have to look for it."

787
00:40:04,332 --> 00:40:06,799
But most of all...

788
00:40:12,807 --> 00:40:14,506
We have to look for
it within each other.

789
00:40:16,811 --> 00:40:20,913
And that's gonna take some time.

790
00:40:20,982 --> 00:40:24,750
But it is time that we
can spend together.

791
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,858
Thank you.

792
00:40:44,405 --> 00:40:46,873
Boss, that was...

793
00:40:46,941 --> 00:40:48,908
Everything that I needed.

794
00:40:48,976 --> 00:40:50,075
Thank you.

795
00:40:52,246 --> 00:40:53,813
Well, I guess you know

796
00:40:53,881 --> 00:40:55,648
what you're gonna
say in your article now.

797
00:40:55,717 --> 00:40:58,184
I'm not sure that's big enough.

798
00:40:58,252 --> 00:41:01,654
I think I have to reach people
on a whole different level.

799
00:41:01,723 --> 00:41:03,422
I owe them that.

800
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:06,558
Come on.

801
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,469
Chester.

802
00:41:17,538 --> 00:41:19,071
If you're gonna be a part of Team Flash,

803
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,573
then you have to stop
beating me at Fortnite!

804
00:41:23,244 --> 00:41:25,177
Cisco, thank God you're here.

805
00:41:25,246 --> 00:41:28,681
Um, there's something
I need to show you.

806
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,216
You still having those headaches?

807
00:41:30,493 --> 00:41:33,027
Nope. Not anymore.

808
00:41:33,763 --> 00:41:35,429
Okay. Why?

809
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:39,434
Hello, Cisco.

810
00:41:41,038 --> 00:41:42,636
How great is this?
