<i>Last season, on</i>
<font color=#ffc30f>"The Flash"...</font>

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,369
<i>Iris isn't Iris...
The real Iris, my wife,</i>

3
00:00:04,454 --> 00:00:06,656
<i>she is somewhere else,
probably in danger.</i>

4
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:07,737
Barry!

5
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:09,652
<i>You targeted me
from the very beginning.</i>

6
00:00:09,737 --> 00:00:11,974
<i>- I saw everything.
- As for the other Wellses,</i>

7
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,113
<i>they're as much a part of you
as yourself.</i>

8
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:15,694
You mean I'm gonna
keep hearing them?

9
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:16,821
- Yeah.
<i>- I did this.</i>

10
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:18,129
<i>I killed the Speed Force.</i>

11
00:00:18,214 --> 00:00:20,290
I need your help to build
an Artificial Speed Force.

12
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,479
<i>I need my speed back
if I'm gonna save Iris.</i>

13
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,527
This whole time
when you looked at me,

14
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:26,020
you saw this other person.

15
00:00:26,105 --> 00:00:29,249
<i>For six years,
I've been in my own personal hell.</i>

16
00:00:29,334 --> 00:00:30,962
You let me rot in here

17
00:00:31,047 --> 00:00:34,630
<i>while you took everything
I created.</i>

18
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,134
Stay out of my way, Flash.

19
00:00:38,218 --> 00:00:40,928
I will be resuming my position
as CEO.

20
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,111
<i>My husband, Joseph,
he worked tirelessly</i>

21
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:45,281
<i>to try to find me,
only to be murdered</i>

22
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:46,976
<i>moments after
we were reunited.</i>

23
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,957
<i>Eva McCulloch has
never faced us</i>

24
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:49,808
head-on.

25
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:50,969
<i>That's about to change.</i>

26
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:52,518
<i>We're gonna find her,
beat her,</i>

27
00:00:52,603 --> 00:00:54,108
and get back everyone.

28
00:00:57,744 --> 00:00:59,960
Yeah, you're right for now,
my sister,

29
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:01,197
but what if?

30
00:01:01,356 --> 00:01:04,033
What if the entire universe
is just some kind of...

31
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,035
cosmic neural network?

32
00:01:08,338 --> 00:01:09,608
Then what you gonna say?

33
00:01:11,993 --> 00:01:14,378
Uh-oh.
Oh, okay.

34
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:16,291
Okay, okay.

35
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:18,994
You know the drill, Chester P.

36
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:20,756
Been prepping this for weeks.

37
00:01:21,655 --> 00:01:23,483
Okay, now, that is...

38
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:25,357
that is not good.

39
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:40,694
Where's Eva?

40
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:42,513
Satellites have her
at 2nd and Walczak.

41
00:01:42,598 --> 00:01:44,742
Make that 3rd and Certo.

42
00:01:45,044 --> 00:01:46,332
You doing okay?

43
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:49,480
I know the Cryo Pod keeps your
residual speed forces stasis,

44
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:51,704
but waking up can be
pretty disorienting.

45
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,683
Call Joe.
Tell him I'm heading downtown.

46
00:01:53,768 --> 00:01:56,670
But, Flash, you only have
1% of your speed left.

47
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:03,034
Then I better hurry.

48
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,227
Eva's coordinates
slowed down.

49
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:13,463
- Maybe she stopped moving?
- No.

50
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:15,632
She's going up.

51
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,591
Why do you keep interrupting
my mission, Flash?

52
00:02:42,714 --> 00:02:43,997
I told you,

53
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:45,967
we're on the same side.

54
00:02:46,052 --> 00:02:48,931
If we're on the same side,
then give me back my wife!

55
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,874
My fractal photons move
at the speed of light.

56
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:16,876
You never had a chance.

57
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,098
I don't want to hurt you.

58
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,880
But I'm cleansing the world
of Black Hole's influence,

59
00:03:33,983 --> 00:03:35,436
so you either die,

60
00:03:35,597 --> 00:03:37,323
or you stand down.

61
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:45,487
Flash, are you okay?

62
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:46,947
Flash?

63
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:48,596
Okay, I picked up Eva
at a warehouse

64
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:49,788
on 199th Street.

65
00:03:49,873 --> 00:03:51,619
Suspected hideout of...

66
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:54,288
Rosa Dillon and Sam Scudder,

67
00:03:54,372 --> 00:03:55,539
aka...

68
00:03:55,784 --> 00:03:57,082
Top and Mirror Master.

69
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,377
Yeah.

70
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:02,932
Mirror, no!

71
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:11,576
You just killed
the man I loved.

72
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:14,786
He never told you
what he really was?

73
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,020
'Cause Sam Scudder
wasn't a man.

74
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:21,951
He was my creation.

75
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,359
My first.

76
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,556
Flash?

77
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,387
Did you make it?
Did you stop Eva?

78
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,174
Flash?

79
00:04:53,897 --> 00:04:55,377

Aired on: <font color=#00ffff>March 02, 2021</font>

81
00:04:57,657 --> 00:05:01,075
Well, that was the best
takeout world tour yet.

82
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,941
Coq au vin from Paris,
sashimi from the Arctic...

83
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:05,684
The Kansas State Fair
funnel cake

84
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:07,384
was Clark's recommendation.

85
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:11,586
I just wish I didn't have
to go back to work already.

86
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:14,487
Is anybody still here?

87
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,496
Allegra went home
for the day.

88
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,403
And Kamilla,

89
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:21,625
she is...

90
00:05:26,388 --> 00:05:27,754
Missing.

91
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:30,509
I've missed you so much.

92
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:35,239
No, this isn't right.

93
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,076
This isn't right.

94
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,531
This isn't right.

95
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:52,072
Barry?

96
00:05:57,284 --> 00:05:59,663
Oh, God.
I'm still here.

97
00:06:04,673 --> 00:06:07,211
Eva hit nine more spots
last night.

98
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:09,381
I missed her every time.

99
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:10,727
How much speed
do you have left?

100
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:12,244
A few days.

101
00:06:13,023 --> 00:06:14,252
Maybe a few hours.

102
00:06:14,345 --> 00:06:16,664
Eva's targeting
Black Hole tech, right?

103
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:18,722
So why go after Scudder
and Dillon?

104
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:20,559
They were working
for Black Hole.

105
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:23,295
I found this
in Scudder's remains.

106
00:06:24,845 --> 00:06:26,722
I'm guessing they've been
on Carver's payroll

107
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:28,398
since breaking out
of Iron Heights last year.

108
00:06:28,482 --> 00:06:30,026
And when they got
in Eva's way,

109
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:31,487
she moved them
off the chessboard?

110
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:34,698
- Well...
- they are not the only ones.

111
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,910
The whole city thinks
that Sue killed Carver.

112
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,193
She and Ralph are staying
way off the grid.

113
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:42,744
And Caitlin and Cisco
are still gone, too.

114
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:44,564
And Iris.

115
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:47,348
I should get back
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

116
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:48,851
If we're gonna stop Eva
and fix this,

117
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:51,070
I need the Artificial
Speed Force up and running.

118
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:55,803
Well, we may not know

119
00:06:55,887 --> 00:06:57,572
where Scudder moved
the Black Hole tech,

120
00:06:57,657 --> 00:06:59,454
but I bet you Dillon does.

121
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:00,940
I'm gonna go in,

122
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:02,822
see if I can get her
to talk to me.

123
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:04,617
Actually, Captain...

124
00:07:05,355 --> 00:07:06,468
I am.

125
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:08,847
Right. When you were
a prosecutor,

126
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:10,308
you put Dillon
n Iron Heights.

127
00:07:10,393 --> 00:07:12,080
And now I'm
her defense attorney

128
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,487
that's gonna keep her out

129
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:15,875
and get her to tell me
where that tech is.

130
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:19,842
That's my girl.

131
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,369
Connecting Fusion Sphere.

132
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,085
Fusion Sphere connected.

133
00:07:27,444 --> 00:07:30,208
- Activate.
- Uh... activated.

134
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,214
Oh, it's working.

135
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:34,477
Now we just have to find
a fuel source to put in it.

136
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:36,604
And then, we can power
the Artificial Speed Force.

137
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:37,826
Exactly.

138
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,207
Hey, uh...

139
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,343
- What?
- One of the sphere plates

140
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:45,923
doesn't look fully magnetized.

141
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:48,667
- Whoa! You can't touch that.
- Oh!

142
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:50,962
If you touch the Fusion
Sphere while it's activated,

143
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:53,171
the Fusion Sphere thinks
you're the fuel source.

144
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:55,362
- Yes.
- And fuse my atoms,

145
00:07:55,465 --> 00:07:58,365
which would lead to a complete
molecular degeneration.

146
00:07:58,555 --> 00:08:00,510
Sorry. I'm just trying
to get your speed back.

147
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,714
Don't hurt yourself
trying to do it.

148
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,071
I'd never want you to do that.

149
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:06,731
- Allen.
- What?

150
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:10,006
Can you get this guy
a coffee?

151
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:11,251
- Wake him up?
- Yes. Let's...

152
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:12,671
Hey, come on.
Let's get a coffee.

153
00:08:12,756 --> 00:08:14,374
Whoa, can I use
that cappuccino maker

154
00:08:14,475 --> 00:08:15,955
- you guys have in the lounge?
- Um...

155
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,562
- Knock yourself out.
- Yes!

156
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:18,838
All right.

157
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:22,612
What? What?

158
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:24,784
Well, it's nice
to see you, too.

159
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:26,518
So it turns out we cracked
the fuel problem

160
00:08:26,602 --> 00:08:28,746
- for this A.S.F. of yours.
- Pas facile non.

161
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:31,911
- Not easy, not great.
- But so much fun, huh?

162
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:33,483
I love all the brainstorming.

163
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:35,699
Plus, we got all the Wellses
back together again.

164
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:38,112
So I expect I need
no introduction,

165
00:08:38,197 --> 00:08:41,587
but, yes, it is I,
master of stage and screen,

166
00:08:41,672 --> 00:08:45,008
Harrison Orson Wells.

167
00:08:45,162 --> 00:08:47,371
- Okay, you're new.
- Nash, as I know you know,

168
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:49,293
when our worlds died in Crisis,

169
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:52,644
particles from our brainwaves
were drawn to you like...

170
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:54,296
Like a moth

171
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:56,715
drawn to a cosmic flame.

172
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,258
Whatever happened
to show, don't tell?

173
00:08:58,342 --> 00:08:59,356
H.R.?

174
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,470
- Oh, nice catch.
- I love this part.

175
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:05,899
So there are
multiversal particles

176
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:08,647
inside you right now, Nash,
made of synaptic energy.

177
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:10,440
Now, we take those particles

178
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:11,930
and you put them
in the Fusion Sphere,

179
00:09:12,014 --> 00:09:15,192
theoretically,
they could power the A.S.F...

180
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:16,617
forever.

181
00:09:18,445 --> 00:09:19,580
Forever.

182
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:22,115
Not only would Allen
get his speed back,

183
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:25,244
but I'd be rid
of you lot forever.

184
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:26,323
No, you'd be gone, too,

185
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:28,205
I mean, because of the whole
organic receptor thing.

186
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:29,486
Oof.

187
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,798
- What?
- What's he talking about?

188
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:35,332
Multiversal particles are
just... they're very volatile.

189
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:37,822
Right? And there's no way
they'll stay in that sphere

190
00:09:37,907 --> 00:09:40,068
long enough to be charged
unless...

191
00:09:40,242 --> 00:09:42,666
unless we have
an organic receptor.

192
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:45,946
The organic receptor...

193
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,774
is me.

194
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:50,977
For the Flash to run again,
Nash Wells must die.

195
00:09:58,554 --> 00:09:59,804
- No.
- Whoa.

196
00:09:59,897 --> 00:10:01,523
- What?
- No way!

197
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:03,696
Nash, you're
our organic receptor.

198
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:05,350
You're the only one
that can contain us

199
00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:07,008
inside the Fusion Sphere.

200
00:10:07,203 --> 00:10:08,954
- By dying?
- Ye...

201
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:10,821
- By dying, Harry?
- Yes.

202
00:10:10,906 --> 00:10:12,581
- How stupid do you think I am?
- Come on.

203
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,084
I have a life here now.

204
00:10:14,168 --> 00:10:15,794
I have people that
I actually don't hate.

205
00:10:15,878 --> 00:10:18,755
I'm not gonna give all that up
so Barry Allen can run fast!

206
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,580
Nash, you're the only one
of us that can help Allen.

207
00:10:20,664 --> 00:10:22,550
And I will, Harry,
by figuring out another way

208
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:25,663
to save Allen that doesn't mean
I have to commit suicide!

209
00:10:25,774 --> 00:10:27,597
- Nash!
- Where he's going?

210
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,769
Bozos!

211
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:34,570
Didn't see that coming.

212
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:36,605
And scene.

213
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:41,695
What the hell?

214
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:51,836
Maybe I can message Kamilla.

215
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:57,182
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

216
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,601
My wife died

217
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:59,946
in the particle accelerator
explosion!

218
00:12:00,057 --> 00:12:01,526
You're not...

219
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:03,186
even...

220
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:05,390
human.

221
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:22,780
You do not control me
anymore, Joseph.

222
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:41,279
She killed Sam
right in front of me.

223
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:42,774
If you tell me

224
00:12:42,858 --> 00:12:45,049
where you and Scudder
were moving that tech,

225
00:12:45,153 --> 00:12:47,238
I can use that information
to strike a deal for you

226
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:49,616
with the state and...

227
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,428
catch Sam's killer.

228
00:12:51,513 --> 00:12:54,757
I wish I knew,
but Sam made all the deals.

229
00:12:57,748 --> 00:12:59,310
That's funny.

230
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,190
Your IHP file says
that you were running

231
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:05,736
a psychotropic drug ring
out of the Meta-Wing.

232
00:13:05,821 --> 00:13:08,448
You were flush with cash, and...

233
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:10,315
It's just that
you felt so sad

234
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,554
when you were
remembering that time.

235
00:13:12,952 --> 00:13:14,181
It's almost as...

236
00:13:14,398 --> 00:13:17,726
Almost as if you were
deliberately projecting

237
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,060
a fake emotion at me,

238
00:13:19,144 --> 00:13:21,146
but why would you do that?

239
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,582
Why would you do that
unless you already knew

240
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:26,455
- that I was an empath?
- How would I know that?

241
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,446
I'm not psychic.
I just cause vertigo.

242
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,949
What else can you do
inside people's minds, Rosa?

243
00:13:37,946 --> 00:13:39,280
Let me show you.

244
00:13:47,298 --> 00:13:49,132
I feel so empty.

245
00:13:51,427 --> 00:13:53,047
What did you do to me?

246
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:55,931
What did you do to me?
What did you do to me?

247
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:58,563
I found a little
kernel of doubt

248
00:13:58,648 --> 00:13:59,977
inside of you

249
00:14:00,062 --> 00:14:02,250
and spun, spun, spun it

250
00:14:02,335 --> 00:14:06,076
into a full-blown crisis
of confidence...

251
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:08,652
like a top.

252
00:14:12,806 --> 00:14:15,683
Scudder's ditzy girlfriend?

253
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,524
It was all an act.

254
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:19,578
I was always the brains.

255
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:21,122
He was just the pretty face.

256
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:23,583
Then Sam cut a deal
with Black Hole.

257
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:26,351
We got rich, but
we were in over our heads.

258
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:29,413
So, when I heard Eva McCulloch
wanted him dead...

259
00:14:29,498 --> 00:14:30,840
You sold him out to her.

260
00:14:30,924 --> 00:14:32,634
And in return,

261
00:14:32,718 --> 00:14:35,847
Eva gave me a cause
to believe in.

262
00:14:36,396 --> 00:14:39,946
She delegated her next mission
to me.

263
00:14:40,264 --> 00:14:41,893
And what I've cooked up for her

264
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:44,849
is gonna blow this city away.

265
00:14:45,055 --> 00:14:46,223
If you are planning something

266
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:47,908
that will put people
in danger...

267
00:14:47,993 --> 00:14:49,119
What?

268
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:51,490
The Flash is gonna stop me?

269
00:14:52,827 --> 00:14:54,438
He can barely run.

270
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,742
You know,
when I first got my powers,

271
00:14:57,826 --> 00:14:59,633
I was an empath, too.

272
00:14:59,974 --> 00:15:02,239
And look what I've grown into.

273
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:04,666
Who knows what
you would've become

274
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:07,072
if only you weren't so...

275
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,964
afraid?

276
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:13,611
Guess we'll never know.

277
00:15:29,414 --> 00:15:31,178
Thought you could use
a pick-me-up.

278
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,527
Thank you.

279
00:15:32,703 --> 00:15:34,487
"Organic Receptors
in Nuclear Physics."

280
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:37,051
- Yeah. Yeah.
- What's an organic receptor?

281
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,992
Ah, no. I'm just, uh...

282
00:15:39,258 --> 00:15:41,243
This is... I'm just helping Barry

283
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:43,844
get his speed back,
or I'm trying to, anyway.

284
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,574
Well, it's nice
to see you care about someone

285
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:48,703
other than me for a change.

286
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:50,878
Well, you're...

287
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,655
You're the answer.

288
00:15:58,611 --> 00:15:59,929
Multiversal particles

289
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:01,782
oscillate at certain
frequencies of light.

290
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:05,136
Allegra can control
electromagnetic wavelengths.

291
00:16:05,221 --> 00:16:07,955
So she can push the particles
out of you

292
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,856
- and into the Fusion Sphere.
- Right.

293
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,775
Charging a fuel source
for the A.S.F.

294
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:13,429
And we take all
that kinetic energy,

295
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,664
and we just transfer it
to the track ring above us...

296
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:17,280
Giving Flash his groove back.

297
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:19,959
- Uh, just... just one thing.
- What?

298
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:22,534
Aren't multiverse particles
a little too chaotic

299
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:24,351
to be contained
in a Fusion Sphere?

300
00:16:24,436 --> 00:16:27,094
Yes, normally they would be,
but Allegra can use her powers

301
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:29,303
to contain the particles
inside the Fusion Sphere

302
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,800
from a safe distance.

303
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:33,243
Hey, thanks
for looking out for me,

304
00:16:33,378 --> 00:16:35,523
but if Nash says
it's gonna work, I trust him.

305
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:39,553
Okay.

306
00:16:42,864 --> 00:16:43,931
All right, then.

307
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:45,731
- Ready?
- Yeah.

308
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:48,115
Yeah. Yeah.

309
00:16:48,312 --> 00:16:49,810
Okay.

310
00:16:49,895 --> 00:16:53,733
The Fusion Sphere is...

311
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:56,653
- ready for particle insertion.
- Okay.

312
00:16:56,737 --> 00:16:59,118
- Good?
- Yeah.

313
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:30,102
Guys...

314
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:32,229
something's not right.

315
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,366
- What's happening?
- Uh...

316
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:38,768
the charge is dropping.

317
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:40,794
I can't hold it much longer.

318
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:52,952
A-Allen?

319
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,450
- Barry, you okay?
- Please be okay.

320
00:17:54,535 --> 00:17:55,995
Please be okay.

321
00:18:08,183 --> 00:18:09,475
Hello.

322
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:11,802
Qu'est ce qui se passe?

323
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:13,772
What are you all doing?

324
00:18:13,857 --> 00:18:16,943
Uh, since when
do you speak French?

325
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:19,472
- Since always, no?
- Why is he talking funny?

326
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,238
I think when the particles

327
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:25,158
left the Fusion Sphere,
they transferred to

328
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:28,235
- Barry Allen.
- So all the brainwaves

329
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,126
of all the Wellses
who've ever lived...

330
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:31,182
Are inside

331
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:34,048
Monsieur Allen's mind.

332
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,423
Allow me, introduce myself.

333
00:18:40,508 --> 00:18:41,966
I'm Sherloque Wells,

334
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,677
master detective,
at your service.

335
00:18:44,761 --> 00:18:46,346
- I'm Chester.
- Chester P. Runk.

336
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,357
- Chester.
- Yeah.

337
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:49,819
- There's a Sherlock Wells?
- Sherloque.

338
00:18:50,891 --> 00:18:52,435
Yes, there's
a Sherlock Wells.

339
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:54,020
- Sherloque.
- -loque.

340
00:18:54,104 --> 00:18:55,104
- -lock.
- Sherlock.

341
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:56,523
- -Ioque.
- -lock.

342
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:57,899
- -Ioque.
- -loque.

343
00:18:57,983 --> 00:19:00,386
- Good. Good.
- No great.

344
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:09,580
Vite, mes ami.

345
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,541
We face a mystery stranger

346
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:14,503
than the King Tut Killer

347
00:19:14,712 --> 00:19:16,881
of Earth-66.

348
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:18,800
The Many Minds

349
00:19:18,962 --> 00:19:21,708
- of Barry Allen.
- Oh, man.

350
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,509
All of them ended up
inside Barry?

351
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:25,750
It looks like, but, listen,
let's not panic.

352
00:19:25,835 --> 00:19:27,503
Between the three of us
and a master detective,

353
00:19:27,587 --> 00:19:29,380
we can figure out
how to fix Barry Allen.

354
00:19:31,414 --> 00:19:32,892
You guys
talking about B.A.?

355
00:19:32,976 --> 00:19:34,465
- He's so fast!
- Oh.

356
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,218
- What just happened to him?
- I think another set

357
00:19:36,302 --> 00:19:38,203
of Wells particles
just took over his mind.

358
00:19:38,288 --> 00:19:40,233
- H.R. Wells.
- How you guys doing?

359
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:42,347
Yeah, so this is simple...
We just get all the Wellses

360
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,152
out of B.A.
into the Futon Sphere.

361
00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:46,531
- It's a... Stop.
- It's a Fusion Sphere.

362
00:19:46,615 --> 00:19:48,074
- Huh?
- Can you stop drumming?

363
00:19:48,158 --> 00:19:49,659
- Huh? Huh?
- Can you stop drum... okay.

364
00:19:49,743 --> 00:19:52,287
The drumming is so annoying...

365
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:55,957
Do you hear the drums?

366
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,377
They are coming.

367
00:19:59,603 --> 00:20:01,045
It is I,

368
00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:03,340
Wells the Grey.

369
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:06,017
- Oh, Wells the Grey.
- There's a wizard Wells?

370
00:20:06,532 --> 00:20:08,177
This is all my fault.

371
00:20:08,422 --> 00:20:10,054
- Oh, my God.
- Do you know Gandalf?

372
00:20:10,138 --> 00:20:12,277
Barry trusted me to help him,
and I screwed up.

373
00:20:12,362 --> 00:20:13,966
No, it's not...

374
00:20:14,555 --> 00:20:16,477
it's not your fault.

375
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,805
Look, here's what we'll do.

376
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:21,792
Um, just blast him again,

377
00:20:21,877 --> 00:20:23,254
and we'll push the particles
back into me.

378
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:24,798
- Uh-uh. No way.
- I'll just make it worse.

379
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:26,759
No, you won't make it worse.

380
00:20:26,989 --> 00:20:28,823
All we got to do is
figure out a way to contain

381
00:20:28,907 --> 00:20:31,242
the particles once they leave
Allen's body, like a magnet...

382
00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:32,827
Uh...

383
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:34,204
Guys? Guys?

384
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,050
What are you?

385
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:46,072
Can't figure it out?

386
00:20:46,555 --> 00:20:48,269
Aw.

387
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:50,678
Did you lose your dissertation?

388
00:20:58,228 --> 00:21:00,146
- You're a copy of me.
- No.

389
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,538
I'm no fractal anomaly.

390
00:21:01,699 --> 00:21:05,327
I am a product
of your broken mind.

391
00:21:05,707 --> 00:21:08,223
- That's impossible.
- No, it's not.

392
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:11,515
You pushed your mind
to find Singh

393
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,603
until it broke...

394
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:15,884
Forever.

395
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:27,523
Leave me alone.

396
00:21:27,608 --> 00:21:29,484
There's
no escaping this, Iris.

397
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:32,261
How long have you been trying
to get out?

398
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,264
Weeks? Months?

399
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:40,103
You are weak
in every universe...

400
00:21:40,187 --> 00:21:43,606
An insignificant speck,

401
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,024
a victim.

402
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:52,156
Okay. Okay.

403
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,825
Don't worry. I'm gonna use
the Mobile Gideon

404
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:56,405
to diagnose him.

405
00:21:56,611 --> 00:21:59,330
So, Gideon,
what's wrong with Barry?

406
00:21:59,414 --> 00:22:01,290
An abundance
of multiversal particles

407
00:22:01,374 --> 00:22:03,626
inside his mind are causing
his cerebral cortex

408
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,044
to overload.

409
00:22:05,128 --> 00:22:07,255
Yeah, all those brainwaves
at once?

410
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:09,090
It's like when Grodd
was trapped in his mind,

411
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:11,342
but to an infinite degree.

412
00:22:11,426 --> 00:22:13,094
Only Barry Allen's
speed healing

413
00:22:13,178 --> 00:22:14,887
is keeping him alive now.

414
00:22:14,971 --> 00:22:18,349
Gideon, what happens
when his speed runs out?

415
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:21,060
If the particles remain
inside his brain,

416
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:23,312
Barry Allen
will instantly die.

417
00:22:36,241 --> 00:22:37,575
Barry is going to die

418
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,114
- because of what I did to him.
- No. No.

419
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:41,669
I should've trusted my gut.

420
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:43,873
Look, I knew
we needed something else

421
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,153
- to keep the sphere intact.
- Yeah.

422
00:22:45,237 --> 00:22:47,170
That was supposed
to be my stupid powers.

423
00:22:47,254 --> 00:22:49,043
No, they're not stupid, okay?

424
00:22:49,323 --> 00:22:51,600
The particles always
needed something stronger,

425
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:55,136
like some sort of...

426
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:58,012
I don't know, some sort
of organic receptor.

427
00:23:00,945 --> 00:23:04,065
That's what you were
researching in your office.

428
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:08,121
You let me think
I was the only solution,

429
00:23:08,206 --> 00:23:10,121
when this whole time,
there was another way?

430
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:12,337
- No, it's not that simple...
- Yes, it is.

431
00:23:12,422 --> 00:23:15,591
- You lied!
- Yes! I lied!

432
00:23:15,975 --> 00:23:17,700
Because
I'm the organic receptor.

433
00:23:21,997 --> 00:23:23,968
And I'm not ready to die yet.

434
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,185
Okay, look,
Barry wouldn't let anyone die

435
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,007
for the Artificial Speed Force.

436
00:23:33,091 --> 00:23:35,593
Yeah, so why lie about it?

437
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:41,517
Because I was scared.

438
00:23:43,935 --> 00:23:45,353
I get it.

439
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,353
I thought you had changed.

440
00:23:51,901 --> 00:23:53,194
Chuck...

441
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,909
It's Chester P.,
actually, but...

442
00:23:54,994 --> 00:23:57,155
I need a way
to aim the particles

443
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,283
after I push them out of Barry.

444
00:23:59,469 --> 00:24:02,098
Like a particle magnet?

445
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:04,580
I can build that.

446
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:06,557
Oh, I mean, I can try.

447
00:24:06,831 --> 00:24:08,081
Lead the way.

448
00:24:18,354 --> 00:24:20,148
What the hell?

449
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,964
Harry...

450
00:24:25,247 --> 00:24:28,250
Look at these
brainwave ratings.

451
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,284
Allen's cerebellum
is burning up.

452
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,749
Harry, if you want the kid
to survive,

453
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,626
- then maybe you better relax...
- I'm fine!

454
00:24:33,734 --> 00:24:35,638
I'm fine.
Do not touch me.

455
00:24:35,753 --> 00:24:36,776
Mm.

456
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,677
What happened
to the J.V. squad?

457
00:24:41,762 --> 00:24:42,979
- Ah.
- Why are you

458
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,815
moping around here
instead of helping them?

459
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,977
Oh, they don't want my help.

460
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:47,562
- Right?
- Mm.

461
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:49,641
Frankly, I don't blame them.

462
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,637
- Garcia found out the truth?
- Yeah.

463
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,470
You know what Cisco said
after Crisis?

464
00:24:57,555 --> 00:25:00,230
He said, "An infinite number
of Harrison Wells,

465
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:03,068
and we're stuck with the one
who killed the Multiverse."

466
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:06,877
And every day
I ask myself, why?

467
00:25:06,962 --> 00:25:09,539
Why am I the one
left standing?

468
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,066
So who should've
gotten the slot?

469
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,015
One of us bozos?

470
00:25:17,493 --> 00:25:18,583
You're not bozos.

471
00:25:18,668 --> 00:25:20,252
I only called you that
because I find

472
00:25:20,337 --> 00:25:23,089
the Wells very annoying...
Present company excluded.

473
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:25,436
But you know what you are?

474
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,152
You're a...
daily reminder

475
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:32,340
that even though
we may all look the same,

476
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:34,725
we're not the same...

477
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:39,189
because you're all
good men.

478
00:25:41,657 --> 00:25:42,939
And I'm...

479
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:46,681
I'm not.

480
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:49,970
So you're a selfish jerk.

481
00:25:50,096 --> 00:25:52,556
- Hmm.
- You think that I wasn't?

482
00:25:52,687 --> 00:25:54,395
That we all weren't?

483
00:25:55,231 --> 00:25:58,607
Hell, when I met this team,
I was working for Zoom.

484
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,434
H.R. lied.

485
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,020
Sherloque...

486
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:05,161
kept secrets.

487
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,816
We all came here broken men.

488
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:12,267
Thanks to Team Flash,

489
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,512
eventually
we learned to be better.

490
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:20,526
That's why I believe
in you, Nash.

491
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:24,086
There's a good man
in there somewhere.

492
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:29,005
You just need to dig him up,
let him breathe.

493
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:42,494
You're not real.
You're not real.

494
00:26:42,579 --> 00:26:43,823
Boo.

495
00:26:49,168 --> 00:26:50,764
- No, I'm not crazy.
- Yeah, you are.

496
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,372
And there's only two options
in this place...

497
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,079
Survival...

498
00:26:55,903 --> 00:26:57,685
Or madness.

499
00:26:58,254 --> 00:26:59,854
No.

500
00:27:01,183 --> 00:27:03,059
This is not neural dissonance.

501
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:05,291
I'm not seeing you
because I'm...

502
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:07,791
I'm crazy and broken.

503
00:27:08,774 --> 00:27:10,761
This is something else...

504
00:27:12,111 --> 00:27:13,885
someone else.

505
00:27:22,189 --> 00:27:24,581
Keep trying to break me down...

506
00:27:25,158 --> 00:27:27,940
because I am not afraid
of the woman that I am today.

507
00:27:29,171 --> 00:27:30,775
But you are...

508
00:27:31,422 --> 00:27:33,071
Eva.

509
00:27:34,716 --> 00:27:37,164
You want me distracted.

510
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,850
I must be getting close...

511
00:27:41,557 --> 00:27:43,003
to finding my way out of here.

512
00:27:43,088 --> 00:27:44,568
You can push yourself
until you break,

513
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,794
and you will never escape
this world.

514
00:27:48,414 --> 00:27:49,575
I'm sorry, Iris,

515
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,746
but... if you can't accept
my conditions either,

516
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:55,654
you might never see
your husband again.

517
00:28:11,377 --> 00:28:14,206
- Wow.
- You actually came back.

518
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:15,864
I'm a defense attorney, Rosa.

519
00:28:15,983 --> 00:28:17,509
I can handle
a few mind games.

520
00:28:17,593 --> 00:28:19,219
I'm here to get you a deal.

521
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:22,131
Am I supposed to be
intimidated by you now?

522
00:28:22,562 --> 00:28:24,808
The woman who's afraid
of her own powers?

523
00:28:25,008 --> 00:28:28,937
- Maybe you're right, okay?
- Maybe... maybe I am afraid.

524
00:28:29,297 --> 00:28:31,947
When I first
got these abilities,

525
00:28:32,032 --> 00:28:35,418
I was so excited.

526
00:28:35,573 --> 00:28:38,592
But then when my powers...
They started to grow

527
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:40,114
and change,

528
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:42,021
and I...

529
00:28:44,655 --> 00:28:48,489
I bottled them up
because I was afraid.

530
00:28:48,973 --> 00:28:51,960
I was afraid I was gonna
become someone like you.

531
00:28:56,006 --> 00:28:58,199
Are you trying to rile me up?

532
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:01,033
No, Rosa.

533
00:29:01,152 --> 00:29:04,155
I'm trying
to remind myself

534
00:29:05,054 --> 00:29:07,381
of all of that fear

535
00:29:07,883 --> 00:29:09,892
that I have locked down

536
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:13,055
deep inside...

537
00:29:13,732 --> 00:29:16,776
so that I can put it all
into you.

538
00:29:19,696 --> 00:29:23,283
My heart... is... racing!

539
00:29:27,162 --> 00:29:28,465
You want to go
back to prison?

540
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,802
Or do you want to tell me
what you're planning?

541
00:29:34,246 --> 00:29:35,598
Hey. What's wrong?

542
00:29:35,683 --> 00:29:37,130
There's a supersonic jet
about to leave

543
00:29:37,214 --> 00:29:38,673
a secret Black Hole site
in the badlands,

544
00:29:38,757 --> 00:29:40,175
and it is loaded

545
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:43,345
with all of Carver's
remaining tech.

546
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,099
But that's not the only thing
it's carrying.

547
00:29:48,606 --> 00:29:50,615
Rosa Dillon planted a bomb on board.

548
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,517
If it blows over this city,
hundreds of people will die.

549
00:29:53,602 --> 00:29:56,188
And the Flash isn't
fast enough to stop it.

550
00:30:05,193 --> 00:30:06,903
- Okay. Okay.
- Here, put this on.

551
00:30:06,988 --> 00:30:09,953
Once Allegra pushes
the particles outside of Barry,

552
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:12,354
these ionic circuits will catch
them, put them back into you.

553
00:30:12,438 --> 00:30:14,272
- Smart, Runk.
- That's brilliant.

554
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:16,103
Thanks.

555
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:19,714
Listen, when this is over,

556
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:21,466
I'll find a way
to make this up to you.

557
00:30:21,688 --> 00:30:23,396
This is a pretty good start.

558
00:30:24,428 --> 00:30:26,136
- Ready?
- Yeah. - Yeah.

559
00:30:37,983 --> 00:30:39,118
Hey. Hey, hey.

560
00:30:39,203 --> 00:30:40,948
It's working.
Keep going.

561
00:30:51,997 --> 00:30:53,015
Barry?

562
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,000
Are you... Barry?

563
00:31:00,255 --> 00:31:01,798
- Yeah.
- It's really me.

564
00:31:01,882 --> 00:31:03,933
Hey, hey.

565
00:31:04,026 --> 00:31:05,361
All right,
let's celebrate later,

566
00:31:05,504 --> 00:31:06,983
because we still have
a supersonic jet

567
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:09,587
about to explode over the city.

568
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:12,385
I still can't stop it.

569
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:18,648
The plane's only
three minutes out.

570
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,024
We need a plan.

571
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,433
No.

572
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:24,395
We need the Flash.

573
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:25,530
Nash!

574
00:31:25,614 --> 00:31:27,073
- That'll kill you.
- I know.

575
00:31:27,157 --> 00:31:29,365
But I'm the organic receptor
that we need.

576
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,661
You're getting your speed back.

577
00:31:31,858 --> 00:31:32,928
Hey! Hey!

578
00:31:33,013 --> 00:31:34,330
We'll find another way.

579
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:35,665
What other way, Allen?

580
00:31:35,749 --> 00:31:37,625
- There's no time.
- Nash.

581
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:39,669
You don't have to do this
just to prove a point.

582
00:31:39,753 --> 00:31:41,838
I'm not doing it
to prove a point.

583
00:31:41,922 --> 00:31:44,728
I'm doing it because
I won't watch you die.

584
00:31:45,168 --> 00:31:47,307
I won't let any of you die.

585
00:31:47,721 --> 00:31:48,757
Don't! Don't! Don't!

586
00:31:48,842 --> 00:31:51,123
No, no, no, no, no.
If you touch him, we'll lose you, too.

587
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:56,644
Nash, please.

588
00:31:56,876 --> 00:31:59,104
I can't let anyone else
die for me.

589
00:31:59,189 --> 00:32:01,532
I've already lost
so many people.

590
00:32:02,818 --> 00:32:05,107
Do you know what I feel
right now, Allen?

591
00:32:07,658 --> 00:32:09,150
Pride.

592
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:11,645
Honor.

593
00:32:12,536 --> 00:32:15,121
It's been so long
since I felt those things.

594
00:32:16,294 --> 00:32:17,448
And it's not just me.

595
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:19,070
The Council feels it, too.

596
00:32:19,155 --> 00:32:20,918
And we've made our decision.

597
00:32:21,002 --> 00:32:22,253
We're doing this, Allen.

598
00:32:22,337 --> 00:32:24,881
- Is it charging?
- Uh...

599
00:32:28,385 --> 00:32:30,499
Yeah, the Fusion Sphere
is charging.

600
00:32:31,615 --> 00:32:35,511
How can I be the Flash
without a Wells on this team?

601
00:32:37,352 --> 00:32:39,438
You've always been the Flash.

602
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:44,038
You always will be...

603
00:32:45,527 --> 00:32:46,944
with or without me.

604
00:32:55,078 --> 00:32:57,038
Hey, B.A.

605
00:32:57,148 --> 00:32:58,289
How's it going?

606
00:32:58,373 --> 00:33:00,625
You're so fast.

607
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:03,434
No, no, no.
B.A., don't be upset.

608
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,895
This... this is not goodbye.
It's just...

609
00:33:07,427 --> 00:33:09,468
till our next communion.

610
00:33:15,098 --> 00:33:16,599
Not great, hmm?

611
00:33:16,683 --> 00:33:19,185
Our current situation, huh?
But...

612
00:33:19,284 --> 00:33:20,718
it will be.

613
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:23,482
<i>Speaking French...</i>

614
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,155
Allen...

615
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:33,533
you know, when I came
to your stupid Earth...

616
00:33:34,868 --> 00:33:36,743
With its good burgers...

617
00:33:38,397 --> 00:33:40,289
I was a broken man...

618
00:33:40,422 --> 00:33:43,543
Lost, angry,
blah, blah, blah,

619
00:33:43,627 --> 00:33:45,913
and you showed me...

620
00:33:47,422 --> 00:33:49,805
how to be a better person.

621
00:33:51,452 --> 00:33:54,811
And I'll always be grateful
for our friendship.

622
00:33:55,572 --> 00:33:56,739
Now...

623
00:34:00,102 --> 00:34:01,492
Run.

624
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:04,527
Barry...

625
00:34:05,854 --> 00:34:07,105
run.

626
00:34:10,196 --> 00:34:11,655
We're at 80%.

627
00:34:15,674 --> 00:34:17,366
You got this.

628
00:34:32,551 --> 00:34:36,262
After I'm gone...

629
00:34:36,346 --> 00:34:39,097
look out for one another.

630
00:37:32,856 --> 00:37:35,534
A.R.G.U.S. was waiting
for the jet when it landed.

631
00:37:36,313 --> 00:37:38,506
They seized all
the Black Hole tech on board.

632
00:37:39,904 --> 00:37:41,530
All thanks to the Flash.

633
00:37:44,242 --> 00:37:47,062
So Nash died a hero.

634
00:37:47,929 --> 00:37:48,996
And I...

635
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,606
I never really
got to know him.

636
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:52,998

637

638
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,631

639
00:37:58,715 --> 00:38:00,371
that none of us will...

640
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,270
ever be the same.

641
00:38:07,265 --> 00:38:09,398
But we all heard
what Nash said.

642
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,543
He was so happy
to have you in his life.

643
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:18,795
Thanks, Chester.

644
00:38:20,738 --> 00:38:22,531
Y-you can call me Chuck.

645
00:38:27,192 --> 00:38:29,155
I need to tell
the rest of the team.

646
00:38:30,752 --> 00:38:33,350
I'll call Carla,
make sure Caitlin knows.

647
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:37,005
Cisco's gonna want to come back
from his trip.

648
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:39,992
Harry was like a father to him.

649
00:38:41,247 --> 00:38:43,633
When they were all in my mind,
I could...

650
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:46,411
I could feel their spirits.

651
00:38:47,013 --> 00:38:49,485
I could feel
how much they loved me.

652
00:38:50,305 --> 00:38:52,268
They gave themselves up for me.

653
00:38:56,318 --> 00:38:58,471
How am I supposed
to live with that?

654
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:02,444
Uh, I think that's the point.

655
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:05,656
You know, they put themselves
in the A.S.F.

656
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,552
so you could live...

657
00:39:08,048 --> 00:39:09,966
and thrive.

658
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,496
And now, whenever you run,

659
00:39:12,924 --> 00:39:16,109
it'll kind of be like
they'll be running with you.

660
00:39:16,462 --> 00:39:17,731
Right?

661
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:20,296
Mm-hmm.

662
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,468
You know, Nash wasn't

663
00:39:26,915 --> 00:39:29,529
the only one who rose
to the occasion today.

664
00:39:31,047 --> 00:39:33,684
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you guys.

665
00:39:42,721 --> 00:39:44,139
So...

666
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:46,332
what now, Flash?

667
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:50,384
We go save Iris
and our friends.

668
00:39:51,786 --> 00:39:53,626
