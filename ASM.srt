1
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:40,284
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:40,318 --> 00:00:44,947
Ready or not, here I come.

3
00:01:57,012 --> 00:01:59,436
Dad?

4
00:01:59,628 --> 00:02:02,706
Dad?!

5
00:03:05,387 --> 00:03:08,464
You're gonna stay with aunt May
and uncle Ben for little while.

6
00:03:08,498 --> 00:03:11,810
I want to go with you.

7
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:17,083
Doesn't like crust on his sandwiches.

8
00:03:17,116 --> 00:03:20,001
And he likes to sleep with
a little light on at night.

9
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:23,193
Come on.

10
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,000
Dad...

11
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:30,500
Be good.

12
00:03:48,015 --> 00:03:51,455
- Sorry.
- Morning Flash.

13
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:56,992
Good morning Parker.

14
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:05,299
Hey, it's Peter, right?

15
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:09,176
- I really like your photos.
- Oh, thanks.

16
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,012
Hey listen, are you busy Friday night?

17
00:04:16,294 --> 00:04:20,136
Cool, can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?

18
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:23,612
I just, really wanted to put
him a good one for his birthday.

19
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:27,053
That's really nice of you,
that's such a nice thought.

20
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:32,002
- I'm gonna get the old, old schedule.
- OK.

21
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:34,851
- Parker!
- Yes sir?

22
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,127
You want to keep that skateboard?

23
00:04:36,162 --> 00:04:39,551
- Yeah.
- Keep it off the ground, wheels up!

24
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:41,259
- Like that?
- That's it!

25
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:42,096
OK!

26
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,872
Eat your vegetables Gordon, come on!

27
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,300
Hey Parker, come on,
get a picture of this!

28
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,366
Put him down man.
Don't eat it, don't eat that.

29
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:29,829
- Take a picture, Parker.
- Put him down Flash.

30
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:35,989
- Take a picture.
- Put him down, Eugene!

31
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:44,324
Come on! Get up Parker!

32
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:47,663
Get up! Come on!

33
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:54,992
- I'm still not taking the picture.
- Stay down Parker!

34
00:05:55,026 --> 00:05:58,780
- Who wants one more?!
- Flash!

35
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:02,524
Flash, are we still on
for after school today?

36
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,458
My house, 3:30? I hope
you've been doing your homework

37
00:06:05,493 --> 00:06:08,642
last time I was very disappointed in you.

38
00:06:08,678 --> 00:06:13,590
Flash, how about we go
to class? How about it?

39
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,456
Whatever.

40
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,098
I thought that was great,
what you did out there.

41
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:48,639
It was stupid, but it was great.

42
00:06:48,678 --> 00:06:51,825
You should probably go to the
nurse, you might have a concussion.

43
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:56,231
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?

44
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:58,475
I know your name.

45
00:06:58,513 --> 00:07:01,544
I just want to know
if you know your name.

46
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:03,825
Peter.

47
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:07,523
- Parker, Peter Parker.
- OK.

48
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:17,083
- I'd still go to the nurse, though.
- You're Gwen, right?

49
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:19,955
Gwen Stacy.

50
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,296
I'm making spaghetti
and meat balls tonight.

51
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:29,460
You're serious? Spaghetti...

52
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:32,413
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meat balls, huh?

53
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:36,694
Oh my God, what happened to your face?

54
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:40,530
I'm alright, I fell, skating.

55
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:47,209
Ben Parker, don't you even think about
leaving that filthy box in my kitchen.

56
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:49,728
- These are my bowling trophies.
- Oh, then by all means,

57
00:07:49,763 --> 00:07:51,727
please, leave that
filthy box in my kitchen.

58
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,773
- What happened to you?
- He fell.

59
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:56,286
Why you kids ride those
things I'll never know.

60
00:07:56,326 --> 00:07:58,122
Because it's stupid and dangerous,

61
00:07:58,122 --> 00:08:00,218
remember when we were
stupid and dangerous?

62
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,091
- No.
- Trust me, we were.

63
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:06,205
- Good to know. Hey, where's the flood?
- Follow me, I'll show you.

64
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,402
- You serious?
- Yes!

65
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,797
I think it's the condenser tray.

66
00:08:12,797 --> 00:08:15,158
No, too much water for the condenser tray

67
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:18,409
or the heat exchange tubings,
this is gotta be the filling.

68
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:20,862
That's the only thing
that makes any sense.

69
00:08:20,902 --> 00:08:24,313
- Can you fix it?
- No, not tonight.

70
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:26,919
- I'll go by the hardware store tomorrow.
- Good deal,

71
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:29,494
meanwhile put this on your face.

72
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:32,976
How's the other guy look?

73
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:36,819
Come on, I know a right
cross when I see one.

74
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:40,974
Yes or no, do I have to
call somebody's father?

75
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:43,231
No, no.

76
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,887
I wouldn't tell your aunt May.

77
00:08:45,922 --> 00:08:50,001
Pity the poor kid who'd
have to suffer her wrath.

78
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:53,682
Hey, before you come up, see if
there's anything else worth saving.

79
00:08:53,786 --> 00:08:54,830
Yeah.

80
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:17,477
- Excuse me?
- What?

81
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:18,994
Can I help you?

82
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:23,267
I don't know, I'm here
to see Dr. Connors.

83
00:12:23,301 --> 00:12:26,806
You'll find yourself to the left.

84
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,045
You are here for the internship?

85
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:31,001
Yeah. Yeah.

86
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:36,092
OK, you'll find your badge to the left.

87
00:12:39,547 --> 00:12:44,196
- Are you having trouble finding yourself?
- No, I got it.

88
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:48,958
OK, Mr. Gueverra.

89
00:12:48,998 --> 00:12:51,282
- Gracias.
- De nada.

90
00:12:51,316 --> 00:12:53,532
<i>Welcome to Oscorp.</i>

91
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:56,108
<i>Born from the mind of our
founder, Norman Osborn,</i>

92
00:12:56,147 --> 00:12:59,761
<i>the Oscorp Tower has its
108 floors of innovation.</i>

93
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:03,074
<i>Our scientific minds are
pushing the boundaries</i>

94
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:06,351

00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,621
<i>The future lies within.</i>

96
00:13:08,656 --> 00:13:12,389
Welcome to Oscorp, my name is Gwen
Stacy, I'm a senior at Midtown Science,

97
00:13:12,428 --> 00:13:14,497
and I'm also head intern to Dr. Connors,

98
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:16,678
so I'll be with you for
the duration of your visit.

99
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,343
Where I go, you go,
that's the basic rule.

100
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:23,350
If you remember that all will be fine,
and if you forget that then...

101
00:13:24,144 --> 00:13:26,905
Tell them Rodrigo Gueverra is down here!

102
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,668
Please, just tell them
Rodrigo Gueverra is down here!

103
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:33,356
I guess I don't need to tell you
what happens if you forget that.

104
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:36,217
Shall we?

105
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:44,475
Come around this way.

106
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:50,950
- Good afternoon Gwen.
- Dr. Connors.

107
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:54,828
Welcome, my name is Dr. Curtis Connors.

108
00:13:54,864 --> 00:13:57,645
And yes, in case you're
wondering, I'm a southpaw.

109
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,053
I'm not a cripple, I'm
a scientist and I'm the

110
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:02,390
world's foremost
authority on Herpetology,

111
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,389
that's reptiles for those
of you that don't know.

112
00:14:05,425 --> 00:14:10,822
But like the Parkinson's patient who watches
on in horror as her body slowly betrays her,

113
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:16,220
or the man with Macular Degenerations,
whose eyes grow dimmer each day,

114
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:21,818
I long to fix myself, I want to
create a world without weakness.

115
00:14:21,853 --> 00:14:25,983
Anyone cares to venture
a guess just how? Yes?

116
00:14:26,018 --> 00:14:27,149
Stem cells?

117
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:31,927
Promising, but the solution
I'm thinking of is more, radical.

118
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:39,093
- No one?
- Cross-species genetics.

119
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:49,728
Person gets Parkinson's when the brain cells
that produce dopamine start to disappear.

120
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:54,572
But a zebra fish has the ability
to regenerate cells on command.

121
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:59,725
If you can somehow give this ability to the
woman you're talking about, that's that...

122
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,283
She's curing herself.

123
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:05,883
You just have to look
pass the gills on her neck.

124
00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:11,683
And you are?

125
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:14,229
He's one of the Midtown Science's
best and brightest.

126
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:14,783
Really?

127
00:15:15,355 --> 00:15:16,999
- He's second in his class.
- Oh.

128
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,805
- Second?
- Yeah.

129
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:23,196
- You sure about that?
- I'm pretty sure.

130
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:29,793
I'm afraid duty calls, I'll leave you
in more than capable hands of miss Stacy.

131
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:33,512
Nice meeting you all.

132
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,388

00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:44,868
<i>At Oscorp's cross-species division...</i>

136
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,591
Hi.

137
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:52,923
What are you doing Rodrigo?

138
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:56,519
- Oh yeah.
- What are you doing here?

139
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,946
I work here, I don't work here.
I was gonna say I work here,

140
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:03,128
but it seems you in fact work here, so
you know that I don't in fact work here.

141
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:06,719
- Are you following me?
- No, I'm not following you.

142
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,055
- I had no idea you worked here.
- Then why would you be here?

143
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:13,175
I just snuck in because I love science.

144
00:16:13,211 --> 00:16:16,436
- You love science?
- I'm passionate about it.

145
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:20,752
I have to lead this tour group, so I'm
gonna ask you more about this later.

146
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:25,067
Do not get me in trouble,
stay with the group.

147
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:28,897
Alright, guys, I'm gonna take
you to the bio-reactor room now.

148
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,453
I'm sorry! Yo.

149
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,709
We received the results from
the MRNA sequences this morning,

150
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:08,466
they were...disappointing.

151
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:15,373
- So define "disappointing".
- Another dead end.

152
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:18,860
It's the Decay Rate Algorithm.
This is to be expected.

153
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:23,658
- Expected? You said you were close.
- We are close, but it's gonna take time.

154
00:19:23,693 --> 00:19:27,901
He doesn't have time, Norman
Osborn is dying, Dr. Connors.

155
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:31,555
Save him.

156
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:35,118
Or we both loose our heads.

157
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:55,664
Give me your badge.

158
00:19:55,698 --> 00:19:59,034
Give it to me.

159
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,911
Sorry.

160
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:06,526
Disgusting, now I smell like beer.

161
00:21:06,841 --> 00:21:10,079
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to do that, I'm...

162
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:15,609
- Get your hand off her.
- I'm trying to get my hand...

163
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:21,496
- Are you kidding?!
- No, I'm sorry.

164
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,953
- Are you freaking kidding me?!
- Get him Rooney.

165
00:21:28,717 --> 00:21:30,114
- Man, I'm sorry!
- Help him, Brad!

166
00:21:30,114 --> 00:21:30,914
Man, are you alright?

167
00:21:41,747 --> 00:21:44,235
No man, not my board.
Please dude, no...

168
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,988
I'm so sorry!

169
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:01,055
<i>Conney Island next stop.</i>

00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:03,858
<i>Next stop, Coney Island.</i>

171
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:18,698
- Hey! Hey.
- Hey.

172
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:21,520
- Sorry, I'm late, I got a...
- We were so worried.

173
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:26,219
I know, I'm sorry... Watch it!

174
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:35,375
That's a fly, Peter.

175
00:22:43,616 --> 00:22:46,488
I'm so sorry I kept you guys up.

176
00:22:46,523 --> 00:22:52,256
I'm insensitive, I'm
irresponsible, I'm hungry.

177
00:23:00,536 --> 00:23:04,318
- Drinking?
- I don't think so.

178
00:23:04,354 --> 00:23:07,901
This isn't meatloaf.

179
00:23:08,498 --> 00:23:12,042
This beats all other meat loafs.

180
00:23:12,077 --> 00:23:15,586
- Something is very wrong.
- Yeah.

181
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,328
Nobody likes your meatloaf.

182
00:23:23,707 --> 00:23:26,215
I got it.

183
00:23:28,882 --> 00:23:34,058
- He took the frozen macaroni and cheese.
- I noticed that.

184
00:23:34,098 --> 00:23:36,846
Why didn't you tell me you
didn't like my meat loaf?

185
00:23:36,885 --> 00:23:39,711
You could have said
that to me 37 years ago,

186
00:23:39,746 --> 00:23:42,538
how many meat loafs have I made for you?

187
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:39,028
Peter? What are you doing up there?

188
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,590
- Homework.
- Be careful.

189
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,009
Sure.

190
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,236
Dr. Connors?

191
00:26:57,636 --> 00:27:01,389
- You don't remember me, I...
- You're the intern from the other day.

192
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:04,390
- Yes, that's right.
- I'm sure you are very nice young man,

193
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:07,898
but this is a home, I'll ask you
to make an appointment in my office.

194
00:27:07,934 --> 00:27:11,892
I'm Richard Parker's son.

195
00:27:16,483 --> 00:27:18,560
Peter?

196
00:27:20,397 --> 00:27:23,352
I'm afraid I can't help you much
Peter, I don't know why they left,

197
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:26,946
or where they were going.

198
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:32,057
- Good reflexes.
- Thank you.

199
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,446
- Thank you.
- I read your book.

200
00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:44,097
It's something. So you really think
it's possible, cross-species genetics?

201
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:48,349
Yes of course, but for years your father
and I were mocked for our theories,

202
00:27:48,384 --> 00:27:52,223
not just in the community
at large, but Oscorp as well.

203
00:27:52,257 --> 00:27:54,783
They called us mad scientists.

204
00:27:54,818 --> 00:27:58,891
And then your father bred the
spiders and everything changed.

205
00:27:58,932 --> 00:28:03,803
The results were beyond
encouraging, they were spectacular.

206
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:08,555
We were gonna change lives of millions.

207
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:12,388
Including my own, then it was over.

208
00:28:12,986 --> 00:28:16,546
He was gone.

209
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:20,075
Took his research with him.

210
00:28:20,109 --> 00:28:23,569
And I knew, without him I...

211
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,833
I...

212
00:28:32,873 --> 00:28:36,947
I was angry.

213
00:28:38,144 --> 00:28:45,052
So I stayed away from you and your
family, and for that I'm truly sorry.

214
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,481
Say...

215
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:58,389
Say it worked, say you got it to work.

216
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:03,581
How much would the
foreign species take over?

217
00:29:03,621 --> 00:29:07,693
What could the side effects be?

218
00:29:08,892 --> 00:29:13,284
It's hard to say, considering
no subject survived.

219
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:17,677
- The problem was always...
- Decay Rate Algorithm?

220
00:29:18,476 --> 00:29:21,669
- Right.
- Right.

221
00:29:21,704 --> 00:29:24,864
- Can I?
- Of course.

222
00:29:46,308 --> 00:29:51,099
Extraordinary. How did
you come up with this?

223
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:01,402
Peter, how would you feel about coming to
see me at the Tower one day after school?

224
00:30:01,436 --> 00:30:04,362
Yeah.

225
00:30:04,396 --> 00:30:07,391
Thank you.

226
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,261
Come on Reggie, run it buddy!

227
00:30:33,662 --> 00:30:36,222
Rejected!

228
00:30:36,863 --> 00:30:39,743
- You did that on purpose, Flash!
- No, but I should have.

229
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,624
You better watch your back.

230
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:50,344
Alright.

231
00:30:55,746 --> 00:30:58,227
Give it up Parker!

232
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:08,228
One sec.

233
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:14,349
Why don't you take it from me?

234
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:20,550
- Go ahead Flash, take it man.
- Go ahead, take it.

235
00:31:40,754 --> 00:31:43,833
Just take it.

236
00:31:43,874 --> 00:31:47,155
Alright, how about this?

237
00:31:47,754 --> 00:31:51,355
How about that?

238
00:31:53,276 --> 00:31:55,521
- Come on Flash!
- Stop playing man.

239
00:31:55,555 --> 00:31:59,595
- Take it from him!
- Come on Flash, take it.

240
00:31:59,631 --> 00:32:03,636
- Do it Flash, stop playing!
- Yo Flash, come on!

241
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,039
Alright, bring it!
Come on Parker! Come on!

242
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,243
They're not gonna make us pay
for the backboard, you know that?

243
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:31,679
I don't care about the backboard.

244
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,471
- Was that true?
- What?

245
00:32:34,957 --> 00:32:39,564
What I heard in there just now.
Did you humiliate that boy?

246
00:32:39,763 --> 00:32:42,329
Yeah, I did.

247
00:32:42,364 --> 00:32:44,519
But this guy deserved it.

248
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:45,732
- Did he?
- Yeah.

249
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:48,765
Is he the kid that hit you?

250
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,851
- Is he?
- Yeah, but...

251
00:32:51,885 --> 00:32:55,047
So all this was about getting even?

252
00:32:55,086 --> 00:32:58,646
If so, I guess you must feel pretty
good about yourself now, right?

253
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,286
Am I right or wrong?

254
00:33:01,321 --> 00:33:03,852
Yeah, I thought so.

255
00:33:03,887 --> 00:33:06,808
Well, thanks to this
little escapade of yours,

256
00:33:06,843 --> 00:33:09,745
I had to change shifts
at work, so you have to

257
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,649
pick up aunt May tonight
at 9 o'clock, understood?

258
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:17,050
Is that understood? OK, good.

259
00:33:18,249 --> 00:33:21,736
She looks familiar.

260
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:24,735
She's the girl on your computer.

261
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:29,371
He's got you on his computer.
I'm his probation officer.

262
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:32,653
Don't forget aunt May.

263
00:33:34,892 --> 00:33:37,292
OK.

264
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:44,635
He's a character, that's my uncle.

265
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:48,240
He's a pathological liar and he
thought you were someone else.

266
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:50,267
Oh man, you don't have
me on your computer?

267
00:33:50,302 --> 00:33:53,156
I took a photo of the debate team,
you're in the debate team so...

268
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,611
- Right.
- So, he must have seen it.

269
00:33:56,645 --> 00:34:00,613
- I was touching up stuff.
- You were "touching up stuff"?

270
00:34:01,921 --> 00:34:04,657
I'm not gonna answer that.

271
00:34:04,696 --> 00:34:07,631
- Did you get expelled?
- No, I didn't get expelled,

272
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,001
I got community service.

273
00:34:12,704 --> 00:34:15,999
So, you want to... I don't know...

274
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:22,420
- Want to what?
- I don't know, just...

275
00:34:27,102 --> 00:34:29,875
I don't know, we could...

276
00:34:30,431 --> 00:34:34,002
Or we could do something else, or we
could... If you don't... We could...

277
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:36,126
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

278
00:34:36,126 --> 00:34:37,036
Yeah, either one.

279
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:41,336
- Really?
- Sure.

280
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:44,945
Alright, good, sounds good.

281
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:50,431
I can't right now, I'm
so busy right now.

282
00:34:50,431 --> 00:34:51,172
Me too.

283
00:34:53,472 --> 00:34:57,912
- But maybe...
- Yeah, just, you know...

284
00:34:57,947 --> 00:35:00,347
- Some other...
- Time, alright.

285
00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:02,101
OK. Alright.

286
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,065
We have protein structurer,
rDNA chromatography,

287
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:37,781
transgenics testing, that's x-ray video.
That's the only one on the planet.

288
00:36:37,815 --> 00:36:42,343
- We have...
- I remember that.

289
00:36:42,378 --> 00:36:45,741
- I've seen that before.
- The GANALI device.

290
00:36:45,777 --> 00:36:47,941
I remember a picture of
that in my dad's office.

291
00:36:47,976 --> 00:36:52,257
The idea was so simple, load
it with an antigen, make reactive cloud

292
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:54,973
which can be dispersed over a
neighbourhood, even an entire city.

293
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,101
Theoretically, you could cure a polio
in an afternoon.

294
00:36:58,101 --> 00:37:00,469
It's incredible.

295
00:37:00,504 --> 00:37:04,057
Well, others disagreed. What if the
device were loaded with a toxin,

296
00:37:04,092 --> 00:37:07,290
what if you wanted to opt-out, you
can't run away from a cloud after all.

297
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:10,856
So here it lies, covered in dust.

298
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,334
What you see here is a
computer model of the lizard.

299
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:16,570
Many of these wonderful creatures
have so brilliantly adapted,

300
00:37:16,604 --> 00:37:19,367
they can regenerate
entire limbs at will.

301
00:37:19,402 --> 00:37:21,533
You can imagine my envy.

302
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:27,166
We're trying to harness this capability and
transfer it into our host subject, Freddie,

303
00:37:27,202 --> 00:37:29,920
the three legged mouse.

304
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,645
Enter the algorithm now.

305
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:37,964
Do you need to take that?

306
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:44,881
<i>System ready for gene incersion.</i>

307
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,060
Check.

308
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,715
What are we trying to do?

309
00:37:50,715 --> 00:37:53,391
- Free up the proteins.
- Create the immuno response.

310
00:37:53,426 --> 00:37:57,036
<i>Beginning trials, pending...</i>

311
00:37:57,077 --> 00:38:00,235
<i>Failed, subject deceased. </i>

312
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:04,236
<i>Pending... Failed.</i>

313
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:06,956
<i>Subject deceased. Pending...</i>

314
00:38:06,992 --> 00:38:09,634
<i>Input algorithm accepted.</i>

315
00:38:09,673 --> 00:38:15,030
<i>Regrowth complete, vitals
normal, blood pressure normal.</i>

316
00:38:15,632 --> 00:38:18,872
<i>Regeneration successful.</i>

317
00:38:18,907 --> 00:38:21,750
Extraordinary.

318
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,235
Thank you.

319
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:31,547
Meet Fred and Vilma,
our three legged mice.

320
00:38:36,745 --> 00:38:40,111
Hey buddy, I got you.

321
00:38:40,145 --> 00:38:43,344
OK, careful, don't want
to sting you by mistake.

322
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,263
Human trials aren't until next week.

323
00:38:48,343 --> 00:38:50,743
There.

324
00:38:57,307 --> 00:39:00,466
Hey, I thought you...

325
00:39:00,503 --> 00:39:04,033
Didn't you forget something?

326
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:09,206
Don't answer that, but I'm
glad to know it's working.

327
00:39:09,753 --> 00:39:14,251
You owe your aunt an apology, big time!

328
00:39:16,143 --> 00:39:19,298
Be a man, get in there and apologize.

329
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:24,799
I'm sorry aunt May, I got...

330
00:39:24,835 --> 00:39:26,978
- Honestly, you don't have to
apologize to me...

331
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:29,232
- Hell he doesn't.
- Ben...

332
00:39:29,418 --> 00:39:33,899
- I'm sorry uncle Ben, I got distracted...
- You got distracted?

333
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:38,803
Your aunt, my wife, had to walk 12
blocks alone in the middle of the night,

334
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:42,752
and then wait in a deserted subway
station because you got distracted.

335
00:39:42,788 --> 00:39:46,666
Ben, sweetheart, honestly, I am
completely capable of walking home...

336
00:39:46,707 --> 00:39:49,345
- You will not defend this boy!
- I'm not defeneding...

337
00:39:49,379 --> 00:39:52,774
- You are defending him! Listen to me son!
- Yeah, go ahead.

338
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:55,531
You're a lot like your father.
You really are Peter,

339
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:59,280
and that's a good thing. But
your father lived by a philosophy,

340
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:03,026
a principle really. He believed
that if you could do good things

341
00:40:03,062 --> 00:40:06,741
for other people you had a moral
obligation to do those things.

342
00:40:06,776 --> 00:40:13,007
That's what's at stake here,
not choice, responsibility.

343
00:40:13,726 --> 00:40:17,083
That is nice, that's great.

344
00:40:17,118 --> 00:40:20,912
It's all well and good, so where is he?

345
00:40:20,946 --> 00:40:24,667
- What?
- Where is he? Where's my dad?

346
00:40:24,702 --> 00:40:28,173
He didn't think it was his responsibility
to be here and tell me this himself?

347
00:40:28,214 --> 00:40:32,206
- Oh come on, how dare you?
- How dare I? How dare you?!

348
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:41,186
Where are you going? Peter
come back here, please!

349
00:40:48,768 --> 00:40:52,840
Ben leave him alone for a
little while, he'll be alright.

350
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,880
Peter?!

351
00:41:08,879 --> 00:41:11,678
Peter?!

352
00:41:15,872 --> 00:41:18,869
Peter?!

353
00:41:22,986 --> 00:41:25,543
That's 2.07$.

354
00:41:26,582 --> 00:41:29,718
- It's 2.07$.
- Yeah, I know.

355
00:41:29,755 --> 00:41:32,821
You're holding up the line.

356
00:41:32,856 --> 00:41:36,619
No, you can leave a penny,
you can't take a penny.

357
00:41:36,653 --> 00:41:41,368
What? - You can leave a penny anytime,
you have to spend 10$ to take a penny.

358
00:41:41,402 --> 00:41:44,211
Store policy. You gonna pay?
You're holding up my line.

359
00:41:44,247 --> 00:41:45,208
I don't have 2 cents.

360
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:47,496
You can't afford your milk,
just step aside.

361
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:51,056
What, daddy didn't give
you enough milk money today?

362
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:54,319
- We're talking about two cents.
- Just step aside, kid.

363
00:41:59,032 --> 00:42:01,231
Really?!

364
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,898
Not cool, man.

365
00:42:17,894 --> 00:42:21,050
Hey man, stop!
Somebody stop that guy!

366
00:42:21,086 --> 00:42:24,208
- Hey kid, little help?
- Not my policy.

367
00:42:24,243 --> 00:42:26,606
Somebody, stop that dude!

368
00:42:27,405 --> 00:42:29,370
Hey stop!

369
00:42:29,405 --> 00:42:32,200
Somebody, stop that dude!

370
00:43:11,765 --> 00:43:16,127
Oh God, help me... Uncle Ben?!

371
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:19,037
Call an ambulance!
Someone, call an ambulance!

372
00:43:19,078 --> 00:43:24,234
Uncle Ben, uncle Ben...
Oh God, oh my God...

373
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:29,268
Oh God...

374
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:46,310
We gave a description to the sketch
artist, I need you to take a look.

375
00:43:49,113 --> 00:43:52,082
No, I don't know him.

376
00:43:52,118 --> 00:43:55,724
I didn't expect you would ma'am.
Homicide detectives are on it,

377
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,049
- we'll see what they turn up.
- OK.

378
00:44:04,737 --> 00:44:08,542
- Can I have that?
- Sure.

379
00:44:08,942 --> 00:44:14,349
There's one other thing, he has
a star tattooed on his left hand.

380
00:44:41,709 --> 00:44:46,596
<i>Peter, I know things have
been difficult lately,</i>

381
00:44:46,631 --> 00:44:49,078
<i>and I'm sorry about that.</i>

382
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,083
<i>I think I know what you're feeling.</i>

383
00:45:07,824 --> 00:45:10,595
Hey Parker.

384
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:15,517
- Not today Flash.
- Come on man, I just want to talk.

385
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,724
Feels better, right?

386
00:45:20,764 --> 00:45:25,951
Your uncle died, I'm sorry.

387
00:45:25,986 --> 00:45:31,141
- I get it, I'm sorry.
- OK.

388
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:39,471
Peter...

389
00:46:22,957 --> 00:46:27,231
Stay away from here, you understand me?!
Stay away from Joe, you understand?!

390
00:46:28,947 --> 00:46:32,304
You like beating on girls?
Like beating on old men?

391
00:46:32,342 --> 00:46:35,018
Hey pal, just keep on walking,
you're in the wrong place buddy.

392
00:46:35,053 --> 00:46:37,181
When was the last time
you were in Queens?

393
00:46:37,217 --> 00:46:40,211
- I asked you a question man.
- Vickie, no! - Is that the gun?

394
00:46:40,246 --> 00:46:43,204
You gonna kill me too?

395
00:46:43,325 --> 00:46:45,318
Stop it!

396
00:46:50,913 --> 00:46:53,789
This guy is crazy!

397
00:47:25,815 --> 00:47:28,049
There he is!

398
00:47:44,424 --> 00:47:48,177
<i>He has a star tattooed
on his left hand.</i>

399
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,472
Oh yeah? Come on!

400
00:48:07,983 --> 00:48:12,059
I know what you look like! You hear me?!

401
00:48:12,092 --> 00:48:15,572
I've seen your face!

402
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,594
<i>Attention all units, in the
confines of precinct 13.</i>

403
00:49:49,629 --> 00:49:54,054
<i>Receiving a 10-30 on west
19th street and Broadway.</i>

404
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:58,446
<i>Assailant is Caucasian male,
mid 30's, 170-180 pounds.</i>

405
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:04,071
<i>Shoulder length blond hair, last seen on
foot heading east bound on 19th street.</i>

406
00:50:32,315 --> 00:50:35,462
- You got a description?
- Well no, he wears a mask.

407
00:50:35,496 --> 00:50:36,326
A mask?

408
00:50:36,326 --> 00:50:38,833
Yeah, and most of
his victims are suspects.

409
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:41,432
Some of them with serious rap sheets,
they're calling him a vigilante.

410
00:50:41,465 --> 00:50:44,293
OK, he's not a vigilante, he's an...

411
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:49,236
Help me, somebody! Arrest
me! Please get me out of here!

412
00:50:49,269 --> 00:50:52,249
Hey look!

413
00:51:01,922 --> 00:51:04,625
Spandex, spandex...

414
00:51:04,665 --> 00:51:06,832
Everything spandex.

415
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:11,193
Extraordinary velocity vector is a
function of both mass and acceleration.

416
00:51:11,232 --> 00:51:13,400
Oh come on, you know
better than anyone that the

417
00:51:13,433 --> 00:51:15,641
weight above any pendulum
has no effect on sling state.

418
00:51:15,674 --> 00:51:19,689
It doesn't effect frequency, but
it's totally a factor in momentum.

419
00:51:56,412 --> 00:52:01,726
Hey aunt May. Yeah,
eggs? Organic, got it.

420
00:52:34,376 --> 00:52:36,653
You know, in the future,
if you're gonna steal cars,

421
00:52:36,688 --> 00:52:38,856
don't dress like a car thief man.

422
00:52:38,891 --> 00:52:40,279
What are you? You a cop?

423
00:52:40,279 --> 00:52:43,504
Really? You seriously think I'm a cop?

424
00:52:43,919 --> 00:52:47,681
Cop in a skin tight red and blue suit?
You're, you're...

425
00:52:47,716 --> 00:52:51,080
You've got a mind of a true scholar sir.

426
00:52:51,114 --> 00:52:54,162
I was going more for one
of the guys who do the

427
00:52:54,198 --> 00:52:57,074
Good thinking, good thinking, use
the window, get out the window.

428
00:52:57,109 --> 00:53:00,191
There you go, you got it.

429
00:53:06,744 --> 00:53:09,383
Crutch!

430
00:53:10,864 --> 00:53:13,342
- Just let me go.
- Is that a knife?

431
00:53:13,375 --> 00:53:16,658
- OK? Yes it's a real knife.
- My weakness, it's small knives.

432
00:53:16,692 --> 00:53:19,429
- Just let me go.
- Anything but knives!

433
00:53:19,464 --> 00:53:22,136
- Oh, it so simple.
- What the hell is this?

434
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:24,725
Webbing that I developed myself, I don't
think you really want to know about it.

435
00:53:24,765 --> 00:53:27,367
Come on, let me go!

436
00:53:29,043 --> 00:53:31,605
Get off man...

437
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:34,803
Come on, let me go! Stop it!

438
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:37,232
- That isn't funny!
- It is kinda funny man.

439
00:53:37,232 --> 00:53:38,691
- Help!
- Shh.

440
00:53:48,305 --> 00:53:52,220
This could have gone a
lot worse, now hold still.

441
00:53:57,336 --> 00:54:00,778
Boys in blue are here!
Yo I got him!

442
00:54:00,811 --> 00:54:03,609
- Freeze! You in the tights, don't move!
- He's not going anywhere.

443
00:54:03,645 --> 00:54:06,375
- Serious?!
- Who are you?!

444
00:54:06,408 --> 00:54:08,405
No one seems to grasp
the concept of the mask.

445
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,684
Freeze!

446
00:54:12,122 --> 00:54:16,799
I just did 80% of your job!
That's how you repay me?!

447
00:54:41,172 --> 00:54:43,773
Alright, that was fun!

448
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:46,371
Bus!

449
00:54:49,768 --> 00:54:52,086
What're you doin'?!

450
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,476
Hey watch out, I'm swinging here!
I'm swinging here!

451
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:20,140
So, 38 of New York's
finest, versus one guy,

452
00:55:20,172 --> 00:55:23,934
in a unitard. Am I correct?

453
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,668
You don't have to wait up for me, you know.

454
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,277
- Yes I do.
- No you don't.

455
00:55:40,294 --> 00:55:44,260
- Yes I do. Where were you?
- I was out.

456
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,381
Did you get the eggs?

457
00:55:47,583 --> 00:55:51,247
Great, forgot the eggs.
I'm gonna get them now.

458
00:55:51,282 --> 00:55:54,908
No, you most certainly
will not, not at this hour.

459
00:55:56,788 --> 00:55:59,792
Look at me Peter.

460
00:56:00,192 --> 00:56:04,279
Take off the damn hood and look at me.

461
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,569
You're hurt.

462
00:56:12,604 --> 00:56:15,487
Where do you go, who does this to you?

463
00:56:15,527 --> 00:56:18,370
- Please go to sleep aunt May.
- Please tell me.

464
00:56:18,403 --> 00:56:21,177
Aunt May please, please,
please go to sleep.

465
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:25,416
I can't sleep! Don't you
understand?! I can't sleep!

466
00:56:36,547 --> 00:56:39,508
Peter, listen to me.

467
00:56:39,549 --> 00:56:42,631
Secrets have a cost,
they're not for free.

468
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:45,914
Not now, not ever.

469
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:54,807
Cross-species genetics
is finally working.

470
00:56:54,841 --> 00:56:58,566
I've used lizard DNA to help
Freddie regrow that limb.

471
00:56:58,601 --> 00:57:01,172
- It's a miracle.
- No, that's hard work and

472
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,849
promise, and it's a step
closer to the primate lab.

473
00:57:03,884 --> 00:57:06,733
- But it isn't time for a little step.
- Little?

474
00:57:06,774 --> 00:57:10,738
- I just mean he can't wait.
- Well, he'll have to.

475
00:57:10,778 --> 00:57:14,740
- Unless he wants to be a lab rat.
- No, it's not what I'm saying.

476
00:57:14,781 --> 00:57:20,262
- So what are you saying?
- You have to start human trials, now.

477
00:57:20,299 --> 00:57:24,189
- No I don't and no I won't.
- Then he's going to die.

478
00:57:24,224 --> 00:57:27,952
People die, even Norman Osborn.

479
00:57:28,073 --> 00:57:30,641
- We are not finished.
- Human trials?

480
00:57:30,674 --> 00:57:33,277
Where on earth are you gonna
find the people to volunteer?

481
00:57:33,313 --> 00:57:36,567
The ward, as far as anyone's
concerned is for a winter flu shot.

482
00:57:36,602 --> 00:57:39,682
I might think that veteran's
hospital is a place to start.

483
00:57:39,718 --> 00:57:43,687
- You've got to be kidding me.
- I don't think I am.

484
00:57:49,572 --> 00:57:53,497
It's little for shock and
indignation Curt, about 15 years late.

485
00:57:53,531 --> 00:57:55,579
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

486
00:57:55,618 --> 00:58:00,262
Richard Parker wore it well, on you
it's a cheap suit, as it was then.

487
00:58:00,297 --> 00:58:04,906
I had nothing to do with that.
- Is that what you told his son, Peter?

488
00:58:09,108 --> 00:58:14,236
- I don't know what you're saying.
- You don't know, or you don't want to know?

489
00:58:14,517 --> 00:58:17,083
I'll remind you what happened.

490
00:58:17,116 --> 00:58:21,920
Richard Parker said just about the
same thing then that you are saying now.

491
00:58:22,801 --> 00:58:26,244
The clock is ticking, Dr. Connors.

492
00:58:36,416 --> 00:58:39,859
I won't.

493
00:58:39,939 --> 00:58:42,658
Fine.

494
00:58:46,664 --> 00:58:50,426
The formula is ours now, anyway.

495
00:58:50,467 --> 00:58:53,230
Say goodbye to that arm you dreamed of.

496
00:58:53,271 --> 00:58:58,434
I'm shutting it down, have your
office cleared out by the morning.

497
00:58:58,475 --> 00:59:02,440
Your toys will be
taken away to, you know.

498
00:59:03,759 --> 00:59:06,282
Night Freddie.

499
00:59:19,663 --> 00:59:20,891
- Hey.
- Hi.

500
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,868
- How's it going?
- Where you headed?

501
00:59:24,101 --> 00:59:27,010
- Monday, B-track.
- It's Thursday.

502
00:59:27,051 --> 00:59:29,232
- It's Thursday?
- What happened to your eye?

503
00:59:29,268 --> 00:59:34,191
- Your eye, it looks bruised.
- I know, I got a rash.

504
00:59:34,226 --> 00:59:37,504
It's pretty bad, did
you go to the nurse?

505
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:41,193
Do you like branzino?

506
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:44,082
- Finger fish?
- I know.

507
00:59:44,116 --> 00:59:47,478
If you want...

508
00:59:47,514 --> 00:59:52,274
You can come to this
address at 8 o'clock tonight.

509
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:55,908
My mom is making branzino.

510
00:59:56,189 --> 01:00:01,031
It's apartment 2016, I didn't write that
part down, I don't know why I didn't.

511
01:00:01,152 --> 01:00:05,594
- I'll remember it.
- 2016.

512
01:01:12,693 --> 01:01:15,046
Hi.

513
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:19,139
- How did you get out there?
- The fire escape.

514
01:01:20,252 --> 01:01:22,722
Your doorman is intimidating.

515
01:01:22,761 --> 01:01:26,937
- It's 20 stories.
- Yeah.

516
01:01:30,004 --> 01:01:32,109
- This is your room. 
- Yes, this is my room.

517
01:01:32,109 --> 01:01:33,372
Books.

518
01:01:38,558 --> 01:01:42,027
Got your mom these...

519
01:01:42,063 --> 01:01:44,428
- Lovely.
- Yeah, they're beautiful, right?

520
01:01:44,428 --> 01:01:45,015
They're beautiful.

521
01:01:45,281 --> 01:01:47,675
- They weren't, they were nice.
- No, they're beautiful.

522
01:01:47,711 --> 01:01:48,403
I'm sorry.

523
01:01:48,403 --> 01:01:51,200
No, it's impressive,
they actually held together very well.

524
01:01:51,528 --> 01:01:56,265
- I'm gonna keep these.
- You have your suit in there?

525
01:01:58,059 --> 01:02:01,722
- My suit?
- It's for dinner.

526
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,426
Are you gonna wear that? That's..

527
01:02:04,459 --> 01:02:08,083
Hey hon.

528
01:02:10,391 --> 01:02:14,056
- You must be Peter.
- Dad, this is Peter.

529
01:02:16,283 --> 01:02:19,748
- Hey, nice to meet you sir.
- Nice to meet you.

530
01:02:19,782 --> 01:02:24,005
Dinner's ready.
Hope you like branzino.

531
01:02:24,044 --> 01:02:26,787
Who doesn't

532
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:27,840
Emma, it's Curt, is he there?

533
01:03:27,874 --> 01:03:30,157
<i>I'm afraid not doctor,
the car's taking</i>

534
01:03:30,197 --> 01:03:32,480
<i>him to the veteran's
hospital in Brooklyn.</i>

535
01:03:32,515 --> 01:03:36,166
No, no, he can't Emma,
you have to stop him.

536
01:03:36,206 --> 01:03:38,971
<i>I would, but I always loose
him when he's on the bridge.</i>

537
01:03:39,011 --> 01:03:42,813
<i>I'll make sure Dr. Ratha returns
your call as soon as possible.</i>

538
01:03:50,709 --> 01:03:55,077
Holton Avenue across the
river, I'm in a hurry.

539
01:03:55,112 --> 01:03:57,097
OK, you want me to take the
tunnel or the bridge?

540
01:03:57,097 --> 01:03:57,809
Bridge!

541
01:03:57,844 --> 01:04:00,518
- Take the bridge.
- Alright, I'm gonna do that.

542
01:04:00,554 --> 01:04:03,004
Hey man, you alright back there?

543
01:04:03,045 --> 01:04:05,808
Are you trippin'?

544
01:04:06,047 --> 01:04:10,212
- Just drive.
- OK.

545
01:04:16,139 --> 01:04:19,543
You're having trouble there, aren't you?
The head goes in the other, Simon

546
01:04:19,579 --> 01:04:22,070
help Gwen's friend with his fish.

547
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:25,836
- I don't know it.
- First time.

548
01:04:26,474 --> 01:04:28,278
George, why don't you
tell us about your day?

549
01:04:28,314 --> 01:04:30,638
Yeah dad, did you
catch that spider guy yet?

550
01:04:30,671 --> 01:04:32,929
No, we didn't catch
him yet, but we will.

551
01:04:32,965 --> 01:04:36,769
He's an amateur who's assaulting
civilians in the dead of night.

552
01:04:36,804 --> 01:04:40,979
He's clumsy, he leaves clues,
but he's still dangerous.

553
01:04:41,012 --> 01:04:44,467
He's assaulting people?

554
01:04:44,501 --> 01:04:49,468
I'm not sure, I mean, I saw that
video with him and the car thief.

555
01:04:49,506 --> 01:04:53,475
I think most people
would say that he was...

556
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:58,120
- Providing a public service.
- Most people would be wrong.

557
01:04:58,598 --> 01:05:02,807
If I wanted the car thief off the
street, he'd already be off the street.

558
01:05:02,843 --> 01:05:06,412
So why wasn't he then?

559
01:05:07,492 --> 01:05:10,416
Let me illuminate you, see
the car thief was leading us

560
01:05:10,449 --> 01:05:12,584
to the people who run
the entire operation.

561
01:05:12,618 --> 01:05:14,986
It's been a six month long
stinger, this is called strategy,

562
01:05:15,021 --> 01:05:19,348
I'm sure you're aware of the term strategy,
you've probably heard about that in school.

563
01:05:21,832 --> 01:05:24,316
Obviously he didn't know you had a plan.

564
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:25,877
You seem to know an
awful lot about this case,

565
01:05:25,913 --> 01:05:27,404
you know something that we don't know?

566
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,326
- I mean, who's side are you on here?
- I'm not on anyone's side.

567
01:05:29,363 --> 01:05:33,250
I saw video on the Internet...
- Oh, you saw the video on the Internet.

568
01:05:33,285 --> 01:05:35,737
- Well, then case is closed.
- No, I'm just saying

569
01:05:35,771 --> 01:05:37,614
if you watched the video,
maybe he'd send you a link,

570
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:39,421
it looks like he's
really trying to help.

571
01:05:39,456 --> 01:05:43,143
Sure, on the Internet he's been made out
to look like some kind of masked hero.

572
01:05:43,182 --> 01:05:45,783
No, I'm not saying he's a hero,
I don't think he's a hero at all...

573
01:05:45,818 --> 01:05:47,549
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm saying he's trying to help,

574
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:49,669
but it looks like he's trying to
do something maybe the police can't.

575
01:05:49,702 --> 01:05:51,838
- Something the police can't?
- I don't know.

576
01:05:51,872 --> 01:05:54,477
What do you think we do all day?
Just sit around, eating donuts

577
01:05:54,512 --> 01:05:57,083
- with our thumbs planted firmly
up our asses? - George. - Daddy.

578
01:05:57,117 --> 01:05:59,505
- Think we do that down there?
- Up your what dad?

579
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:01,852
I think he stands for
what you stand for, sir.

580
01:06:01,888 --> 01:06:05,013
- Protecting innocent people from bad guys.
- I stand for law and order son,

581
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:07,974
that's what I stand for.
I wear a badge.

582
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:10,867
This guy wears a mask, like an outlaw.

583
01:06:10,901 --> 01:06:13,302
He's hunting down a bunch of
criminals that all look the same,

584
01:06:13,338 --> 01:06:15,792
like he's got some sort
of personal vendetta.

585
01:06:15,828 --> 01:06:18,791
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr. Parker.

586
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:21,481
Let's get some air Peter.

587
01:06:21,516 --> 01:06:24,919
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Yes we do.

588
01:06:26,323 --> 01:06:30,728
Thank you for having me, I'm sorry if
I insulted you, it was not my intention.

589
01:06:30,763 --> 01:06:31,381
You're welcome.

590
01:06:31,381 --> 01:06:34,737
Branzino was really good.
Mrs. Stacey, thank you.

591
01:06:34,856 --> 01:06:36,711
You're welcome.

592
01:06:38,138 --> 01:06:39,138
- Dad.
- Yes.

593
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:49,727
That was something.

594
01:06:50,088 --> 01:06:53,523
I'm sorry, I thought he was
gonna arrest me at one point.

595
01:06:53,555 --> 01:06:56,797
I wouldn't have let him arrest you.

596
01:07:00,873 --> 01:07:04,711
- What happened to your face?
- I'm gonna tell you something.

597
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:08,185
OK.

598
01:07:11,701 --> 01:07:14,975
I've been bitten.

599
01:07:17,254 --> 01:07:20,371
So have I.

600
01:07:26,561 --> 01:07:29,920
OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, I gotta
tell you this one thing,

601
01:07:29,955 --> 01:07:32,487
and it's about the vigilante and
the car thief, alright?

602
01:07:32,487 --> 01:07:33,576
Oh, OK.

603
01:07:35,948 --> 01:07:38,226
No, no, no, don't.

604
01:07:38,265 --> 01:07:41,742
Forget that, I'm not gonna talk
about that, I'm gonna talk about me.

605
01:07:41,778 --> 01:07:44,419
What about you?

606
01:07:44,459 --> 01:07:48,212
I wish I could just...
I can't, it's hard to say.

607
01:07:48,252 --> 01:07:52,328
Just say, say it.

608
01:07:54,326 --> 01:07:57,842
Why, what?

609
01:07:58,921 --> 01:08:01,997
What?

610
01:08:25,008 --> 01:08:28,684
- You're Spiderman...
- Shut up now.

611
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,756
Gwen?!

612
01:08:34,795 --> 01:08:37,355
Gwen?

613
01:08:37,391 --> 01:08:39,870
Your father wants you to
come inside, right away.

614
01:08:39,905 --> 01:08:40,366
OK.

615
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:41,929
- OK?
- Yeah.

616
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:48,139
- Gwen...
- I'm coming.

617
01:09:19,032 --> 01:09:22,028
I'm in trouble.

618
01:09:44,629 --> 01:09:48,630
Can you please go and find
out what's going on, Alfred?

619
01:09:54,751 --> 01:09:57,429
Excellent.

620
01:10:56,629 --> 01:11:00,110
Incoming!

621
01:11:19,709 --> 01:11:23,548
Somebody, help!
Help me, my kid is trapped!

622
01:11:33,028 --> 01:11:36,107
I want my dad! Dad!

623
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:38,507
Hey buddy, it's OK.

624
01:11:38,507 --> 01:11:39,589
- Get away!
- It's alright.

625
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:42,594
- Help!
- Hey, look.

626
01:11:42,627 --> 01:11:45,926
Just a normal guy, right?

627
01:11:45,962 --> 01:11:49,354
Wanna hold on to this?

628
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:52,712
Hold on to my mask.

629
01:11:52,748 --> 01:11:56,907
- What's your name? Jack?
- Yes.

630
01:11:56,945 --> 01:11:59,993
Let's get you out of here.

631
01:12:00,027 --> 01:12:00,997
Stay very still.

632
01:12:00,997 --> 01:12:03,221
- Alright.
- I got you.

633
01:12:07,829 --> 01:12:09,909
OK, now I'm gonna undo the belt.

634
01:12:09,947 --> 01:12:12,746
You're gonna hold on
to that seat, on three.

635
01:12:12,779 --> 01:12:17,191
OK, one, two, three.

636
01:12:17,228 --> 01:12:21,226
See how easy that was?
You did a great job.

637
01:12:35,346 --> 01:12:36,940
Jack, climb, now!

638
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,468
- I can't!
- Yes you can!

639
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:48,345
Put it on, the mask, it's
gonna make you strong.

640
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:51,310
Jack, trust me, put it on.

641
01:12:51,347 --> 01:12:54,224
There you go, that's it!
That's it buddy!

642
01:12:54,261 --> 01:12:58,824
OK, now, climb! Come on Jack!

643
01:13:00,108 --> 01:13:02,906
Do me a favor, a little faster, OK bud?

644
01:13:02,946 --> 01:13:05,427
You're doing great
buddy, you're doing great!

645
01:13:05,462 --> 01:13:08,507
That's it, keep coming, keep coming.

646
01:13:09,906 --> 01:13:12,226
No!

647
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:30,826
Oh Jack, thank God.

648
01:13:30,862 --> 01:13:34,346
You OK?

649
01:13:35,704 --> 01:13:41,144
My son...My son...

650
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:48,885
Who are you?

651
01:13:48,919 --> 01:13:52,226
Spiderman.

652
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:39,215
Peter.

653
01:14:45,404 --> 01:14:50,728
Does this scare you?
Who are you gonna tell?

654
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:54,679
No, no.

655
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:58,188
What did that thing on
the bridge look like?

656
01:14:58,993 --> 01:15:02,946
- Real big, too big to be human.
- You got to lay low.

657
01:15:02,982 --> 01:15:07,143
- No, I can't do that.
- You've got to.

658
01:15:07,342 --> 01:15:12,187
- I mean why...
- Because of last night.

659
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:16,013
Those people on the bridge,
whatever was attacking them,

660
01:15:16,415 --> 01:15:20,108
would have killed them.

661
01:15:20,142 --> 01:15:23,761
So, I gotta go after it.

662
01:15:23,797 --> 01:15:28,518
- That's not your job.
- Maybe it its.

663
01:15:32,385 --> 01:15:36,299
I really liked kissing you.

664
01:15:37,024 --> 01:15:41,260
And you're an amazing kisser.

665
01:15:42,951 --> 01:15:46,785
Well, you know, it was good for me too.

666
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:50,613
Yeah?

667
01:16:21,319 --> 01:16:23,965
Hello?!

668
01:16:31,983 --> 01:16:35,750
It's not nice to snoop.

669
01:16:37,191 --> 01:16:40,999
I gave everyone the week off.

670
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:42,334
Yeah.

671
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:46,856
Shouldn't you be at school?

672
01:16:46,892 --> 01:16:51,382
No, I got a free track, I
wanted to ask you a question.

673
01:16:51,422 --> 01:16:55,870
- How would a predator track a reptile?
- Oh you don't, most reptiles

674
01:16:55,906 --> 01:17:00,319
are at the top of their respected
food chain, kings of their domain.

675
01:17:00,353 --> 01:17:03,330
They got to have vulnerabilities, right?

676
01:17:03,365 --> 01:17:06,453
Why the sudden interest
in the cold blooded?

677
01:17:08,214 --> 01:17:12,625
Just asking a question,
I got school stuff,

678
01:17:12,664 --> 01:17:15,431
biology profiles to do.

679
01:17:15,469 --> 01:17:19,639
So because of the cold blood would they
react to sudden changes in temperature?

680
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:22,050
You'd have to catch one first.

681
01:17:22,085 --> 01:17:25,448
Did you know, there's a rumor
of a new species in New York?

682
01:17:25,489 --> 01:17:30,261
- Beautiful and quite large.
- What do you know about it? You seen it?

683
01:17:30,301 --> 01:17:34,390
It's not yet classified.

684
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:40,923
But it can be aggressive, if threatened.

685
01:17:46,932 --> 01:17:48,237
Doc, are you alright?

686
01:17:48,237 --> 01:17:50,625
Never been better Peter,
never been better.

687
01:17:51,422 --> 01:17:55,031
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

688
01:17:55,067 --> 01:17:58,842
I have a new project I'm
working on, I need to be alone.

689
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:08,057
Don't worry Mr. Parker, I'll be back.

690
01:18:08,178 --> 01:18:11,466
Wonderful things are coming.

691
01:18:11,544 --> 01:18:14,591
Wonderful things.

692
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:28,576
Fred.

693
01:18:34,019 --> 01:18:36,557
Mr. mayor, I can assure you if
there was a giant dinosaur running

694
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:39,090
around the streets of Manhattan
you would be the first to know.

695
01:18:39,124 --> 01:18:42,761
So tell your son he can rest easy, alright?

696
01:18:42,798 --> 01:18:46,236
Yeah, you and me both, sir.
OK, bye bye.

697
01:18:46,272 --> 01:18:49,640
Mr. Parker, why are you not in school?

698
01:18:49,674 --> 01:18:51,838
- Got a free track.
- Well I do not have a free track,

699
01:18:51,874 --> 01:18:53,497
so make your point quickly.

700
01:18:53,497 --> 01:18:55,901
There may not be a dinosaur
running around Manhattan,

701
01:18:55,936 --> 01:18:58,479
but there is something more
dangerous and I know who it is.

702
01:18:58,514 --> 01:18:59,957
- You know who it is?
- Dr. Curtis Connors.

703
01:18:59,957 --> 01:19:01,417
Of Oscorp?!

704
01:19:01,457 --> 01:19:02,156
That's right.

705
01:19:02,156 --> 01:19:05,053
Dr. Curtis Connors,
who's also my daughter's mentor,

706
01:19:05,088 --> 01:19:06,933
- is that who you're talking about?
- That's the one.

707
01:19:06,967 --> 01:19:10,327
Recently Dr. Connors gave Gwen
a glowing college recommendation,

708
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:13,316
it was beautiful, when I read it I cried.
But you would have me believe

709
01:19:13,356 --> 01:19:17,314
that he, in his spare time, is running
around dressed up like a giant dinosaur?

710
01:19:17,353 --> 01:19:22,343
Not dressing up as a dinosaur, he has
transformed himself into a giant lizard.

711
01:19:24,222 --> 01:19:29,212
Let me ask you a question, do I
look like the mayor of Tokio to you?

712
01:19:29,247 --> 01:19:31,825
I'm telling you the
absolute truth, this man has

713
01:19:31,861 --> 01:19:34,429
worked for his whole life
on cross-species genetics,

714
01:19:34,462 --> 01:19:36,963
he lost one arm and has
been trying to grow it back,

715
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,076
but there is something unbalanced by the
equation and he has turned into a full lizard.

716
01:19:40,115 --> 01:19:45,466
He's using lizard DNA, he is dangerous and
he's planning something horrific, I know.

717
01:19:45,507 --> 01:19:48,548
OK, alright, I get it.

718
01:19:48,582 --> 01:19:52,972
Here's what we're gonna do, you're gonna go
back to meeting up with citizens of Tokio,

719
01:19:53,009 --> 01:19:57,766
and I'm gonna go back to protecting the
citizens of this fine, fair city of ours.

720
01:19:57,802 --> 01:20:00,682
Sergeant Butler, would you please
escort Mr. Parker back to school.

721
01:20:00,717 --> 01:20:03,122
Captain Stacy, I'm not messing around.

722
01:20:03,159 --> 01:20:05,555
Just bring him in, just
call him in, you have

723
01:20:05,591 --> 01:20:07,948
to call him in, he is
a danger to everybody.

724
01:20:07,983 --> 01:20:11,544
- Please, listen to me!
- Let's go!

725
01:20:14,541 --> 01:20:17,057
- Jimmy...
- Hmm?

726
01:20:17,215 --> 01:20:22,329
Give me everything we have on
Dr. Curtis Connors, OK? Right away.

727
01:20:48,091 --> 01:20:53,458
Subject: Dr. Curtis Connors, own
temperature 89.7, steady for 48 hours.

728
01:20:53,492 --> 01:20:59,020
Blood panels reveal lymphocyte and monochyte
readings consistent with subject's past.

729
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:07,506
Clutching rate vastly
improved, marked enhancement

730
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:11,508
in muscle response,
strength, elasticity...

731
01:21:17,716 --> 01:21:23,717
Eyesight similarly improved, subject
no longer requires corrective lenses.

732
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:34,007
This is no longer about curing ills,
this is about finding perfection.

733
01:21:42,133 --> 01:21:44,734
In attempt to repress
regenerative relapse,

734
01:21:44,769 --> 01:21:49,059
dosage has been increased to 200 mg.

735
01:23:23,012 --> 01:23:26,254
You stopped me once...

736
01:23:26,289 --> 01:23:29,494
You won't stop me again.

737
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:33,817
I'm getting stronger every day!

738
01:24:12,368 --> 01:24:15,651
Oh, that sucked.

739
01:24:25,096 --> 01:24:28,461
Peter Parker?

740
01:24:43,719 --> 01:24:46,929
Come in.

741
01:24:48,136 --> 01:24:53,273
Maybe...you should, consider
coming in through the lobby.

742
01:24:53,436 --> 01:24:59,983
Also, my father is under the impression
that you require psychiatric help.

743
01:25:00,017 --> 01:25:02,558
Peter, what happened?

744
01:25:02,594 --> 01:25:05,804
You should see the other guy.

745
01:25:05,839 --> 01:25:08,096
The other guy,

746
01:25:08,133 --> 01:25:10,384
in this instance being
a giant mutant lizard.

747
01:25:10,421 --> 01:25:15,039
Hey Gwen, honey, do you want
cocoa? Howard's making some cocoa.

748
01:25:17,931 --> 01:25:20,058
No dad, I do not want cocoa.

749
01:25:20,093 --> 01:25:22,153
Honestly, I'm 17 years old.

750
01:25:22,187 --> 01:25:25,681
OK, I just thought I remembered
somebody saying last week that her

751
01:25:25,715 --> 01:25:29,175
- fantasy was to live in a chocolate house.
- Well that's impractical.

752
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:32,105
And fattening.

753
01:25:33,308 --> 01:25:36,242
Chocolate house?

754
01:25:37,125 --> 01:25:39,214
- Sorry dad.
- It's good.

755
01:25:39,253 --> 01:25:43,206
I can't have cocoa
right now because I'm...

756
01:25:43,241 --> 01:25:47,165
Doing this... I have to have...
I have cramps.

757
01:25:48,167 --> 01:25:52,866
I feel kind of pukey and just sort
of, like emotional, I keep crying...

758
01:25:52,906 --> 01:25:55,080
It's brutal.

759
01:25:55,115 --> 01:25:58,208
- You don't want to know,
trust me, it's bad. - Got it.

760
01:25:58,241 --> 01:26:00,737
- Thanks daddy.
- Alright.

761
01:26:24,773 --> 01:26:30,163
- Easy bugboy.
- What did you call me?

762
01:26:36,477 --> 01:26:39,951
- No.
- It's OK.

763
01:26:40,351 --> 01:26:45,230
- I know what this is.
- What is it?

764
01:26:45,265 --> 01:26:49,104
Every day, for as long as
I can remember, my father

765
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:52,695
has left every morning and
he'd put a badge on his chest,

766
01:26:52,729 --> 01:26:56,209
and strapped a gun to his hip.

767
01:26:58,209 --> 01:27:01,204
And every day, for as
long as I can remember,

768
01:27:01,205 --> 01:27:04,200
I haven’t known if he was
going to make it home.

769
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:17,901
I got you, OK?

770
01:27:21,896 --> 01:27:25,430
I gotta stop him, though.

771
01:27:25,465 --> 01:27:28,967
I have to, cos I created him.

772
01:27:30,964 --> 01:27:33,644
What do you mean?

773
01:27:33,678 --> 01:27:37,596
I gave him an equation.

774
01:27:38,153 --> 01:27:42,069
I made all of this possible.

775
01:27:47,861 --> 01:27:51,316
Something my father's
been working on, you know?

776
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:54,774
Secretly, now I realise
why he kept it a secret.

777
01:27:56,849 --> 01:28:01,321
Why this is my responsibility.

778
01:28:02,839 --> 01:28:06,637
I have to fix it.

779
01:28:15,302 --> 01:28:17,783
Let's get out of here.

780
01:28:17,817 --> 01:28:22,333
Let's get out of here,
just for a minute, can we?

781
01:28:22,368 --> 01:28:23,163
- No. - Yeah.

782
01:28:23,163 --> 01:28:24,810
- No. - Yes. Yes.

783
01:28:24,845 --> 01:28:25,810
- No.
- Yes.

784
01:28:25,810 --> 01:28:27,773
If my parents
see me leaving I'm dead.

785
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:37,911
Your parents are not
gonna see you leaving.

786
01:28:49,168 --> 01:28:53,271
<i>Peter Parker... Spiderman?</i>

787
01:28:53,309 --> 01:28:56,521
<i>I'm not the one who needs help!</i>

788
01:28:56,721 --> 01:29:00,223
<i>There will be no more
loneliness, no more outcasts!</i>

789
01:29:00,256 --> 01:29:06,768
<i>Species-wide distribution could enhance
humanity on an evolutionary scale.</i>

790
01:29:06,803 --> 01:29:10,382
<i>One has to adapt to survive.</i>

791
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:15,947
That, changing like the
snake, I might be free.

792
01:29:15,983 --> 01:29:19,387
To cast off flesh
wherein I dwell confined!

793
01:29:19,421 --> 01:29:23,721
<i>Would you give it all up?
After all you know you can do?</i>

794
01:29:23,762 --> 01:29:27,860
<i>All the power you feel?</i>

795
01:29:30,071 --> 01:29:33,364
<i>I can save them!</i>

796
01:29:38,587 --> 01:29:43,652
<i>You are not gonna get in the
way of my plan, Peter Parker!</i>

797
01:30:09,308 --> 01:30:11,703
Go, go!

798
01:30:46,839 --> 01:30:50,036
Nowhere to hide, Peter.

799
01:31:06,209 --> 01:31:10,460
All these souls, lost and
alone, I can save them.

800
01:31:10,495 --> 01:31:14,716
I can sure them, there's
no need to stop me, Peter.

801
01:31:24,177 --> 01:31:27,255
You're not thinking straight doc.

802
01:31:29,652 --> 01:31:32,564
Stop this! This isn't you!

803
01:31:36,276 --> 01:31:38,552
Let's talk this out!

804
01:31:38,589 --> 01:31:40,669
Doc!

805
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:47,456
Oh boy.

806
01:31:51,530 --> 01:31:53,844
Alright, so you don't want to talk?

807
01:31:53,881 --> 01:31:56,722
There you go.

808
01:31:59,117 --> 01:32:02,351
Don't... Make me...

809
01:32:02,387 --> 01:32:05,586
Have to... Hurt you!

810
01:32:43,172 --> 01:32:43,650
Hey.

811
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:44,371
Where are you?

812
01:32:44,371 --> 01:32:45,615
I'm fine, I'm OK.

813
01:32:45,787 --> 01:32:49,240
I'm down in the sewer, I'm tracking him,
I gotta stop him before anyone gets hurt.

814
01:32:49,274 --> 01:32:51,735
But we need an antidote,
do you know how to run a serum?

815
01:32:51,770 --> 01:32:53,206
<i>Yeah, I do it for
Connors all the time.</i>

816
01:32:53,207 --> 01:32:54,748
OK, OK, listen.

817
01:32:54,783 --> 01:32:57,166
<i>I need you to go to Oscorp,
I need you to access</i>

818
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,268
<i>the cross-species
file, it's a blue serum</i>

819
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:01,545
file 12389.

820
01:33:01,545 --> 01:33:02,568
<i>OK, got it.</i>

821
01:33:02,568 --> 01:33:03,545
On my way.

822
01:33:35,341 --> 01:33:39,578
<i>I spent my life as a scientist, trying
to create a world without weakness,</i>

823
01:33:39,615 --> 01:33:41,646
<i>without outcasts.</i>

824
01:33:41,681 --> 01:33:46,043
<i>I sought to create a stronger human
being, but there's no such thing.</i>

825
01:33:46,076 --> 01:33:51,474
<i>Human beings are weak, pathetic,
feeble minded creatures.</i>

826
01:33:51,592 --> 01:33:55,954
<i>Why be human at all, when
we can be so much more?</i>

827
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:59,872
<i>Faster, stronger, smarter.</i>

828
01:33:59,907 --> 01:34:03,761
<i>This is my gift to you.</i>

829
01:34:14,892 --> 01:34:16,089
- Stacy!
- What?!

830
01:34:16,089 --> 01:34:18,004
We've got a confirmed sighting sir!

831
01:34:18,039 --> 01:34:19,773
The lizard is heading
toward Canal Street station.

832
01:34:19,814 --> 01:34:21,894
- What about Spiderman?
- He was inside the high school.

833
01:34:21,929 --> 01:34:24,496
I want that Spiderman off the street!

834
01:36:11,637 --> 01:36:14,402
<i>The lizard creature has
released a biological agent!</i>

835
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:20,440
<i>All efforts of stopping him have failed, he
is now proceeding north on 7th Avenue, over.</i>

836
01:36:23,799 --> 01:36:26,200
<i>- Hey, where are you?
- I'm at Oscorp.</i>

837
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:28,922
- You have to get out of there right now, OK?
- The antidote is cooking.

838
01:36:28,959 --> 01:36:31,488
<i>No, no, no, Connors is on the way.</i>

839
01:36:31,523 --> 01:36:34,121
<i>He's coming to you right now,
he needs the disbursement device.</i>

840
01:36:34,156 --> 01:36:36,887
- He's gonna infect the whole city...
- There's 8 minutes left.

841
01:36:36,922 --> 01:36:39,922
<i>You're gonna wait there for 8 minutes after
what I just told you? People are gonna die!</i>

842
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:42,924
<i>You leave right now!
Listen, that is an order, OK?!</i>

843
01:36:42,961 --> 01:36:45,609
I'm gonna get everybody out.

844
01:36:45,645 --> 01:36:49,725
Gwen! You mother
hover, are you serious?!

845
01:37:05,254 --> 01:37:07,730
He's heading south!

846
01:37:17,131 --> 01:37:19,410
Stand down now or we will open fire!

847
01:37:19,451 --> 01:37:22,453
<i>You are surrounded,
there is no escape!</i>

848
01:38:25,944 --> 01:38:28,447
<i>Clear!</i>

849
01:38:28,482 --> 01:38:30,949
<i>Clear up!</i>

850
01:38:31,947 --> 01:38:34,749
<i>All clear here, sir!</i>

851
01:38:58,637 --> 01:39:01,121
Freeze!

852
01:39:01,155 --> 01:39:06,236
Down on the ground!
Put your hands behind your head! Now!

853
01:39:09,035 --> 01:39:11,275
Parker?

854
01:39:12,475 --> 01:39:17,279
It's headed to Oscorp, and your
daughter is there right now!

855
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:31,961
You got to let me go.

856
01:39:44,482 --> 01:39:47,443
Hold your fire!

857
01:39:52,784 --> 01:39:55,099
Paul, if I didn't see
it I wouldn't believe it.

858
01:39:55,136 --> 01:39:57,347
I won't venture to say
exactly what it is that's

859
01:39:57,382 --> 01:39:59,529
crawling up the both
sides of the Oscorp Tower,

860
01:39:59,564 --> 01:40:03,670
but clearly it is not human
and it is very, very strong.

861
01:40:19,221 --> 01:40:22,011
<i>Time remaining: 1 minute.</i>

862
01:41:34,855 --> 01:41:38,162
<i>Antidote complete.</i>

863
01:41:49,823 --> 01:41:51,788
Oh man...

864
01:41:51,156 --> 01:41:54,041
<i>We are now getting the latest
details, this is just coming in.</i>

865
01:41:54,081 --> 01:41:58,367
<i>The New York police department has
called for a city wide evacuation.</i>

866
01:41:58,405 --> 01:42:01,138
<i>Everything south of 54th street.</i>

867
01:42:01,175 --> 01:42:06,061
<i>If you are south of 54th street you have
to move out of the area immediately.</i>

868
01:42:14,876 --> 01:42:17,765
<i>Spiderman appears to be
heading toward Oscorp.</i>

869
01:42:17,801 --> 01:42:22,090
<i>He looks injured and it is really
not clear if he's gonna make it.</i>

870
01:42:22,130 --> 01:42:24,891
This guy saved my boy on the bridge.

871
01:42:24,931 --> 01:42:28,303
They're clearing us out, something
bad is going down in mid town.

872
01:42:28,339 --> 01:42:31,423
Are you still friends with Mathews, that
crane operator down at the 6th avenue?

873
01:42:31,460 --> 01:42:33,395
- Yeah.
- Get him on the phone for me.

874
01:42:33,428 --> 01:42:35,593
The cops are evacuating
everybody, who the hell cares?

875
01:42:35,627 --> 01:42:37,717
Get him on the phone for me!

876
01:42:55,746 --> 01:42:58,756
Hey Charlie, get me
Enriquez from 54th street!

877
01:42:58,790 --> 01:43:03,478
Angelo get your mug over here.
Walsky, you're getting some overtime!

878
01:43:04,478 --> 01:43:08,166
<i>All tower cranes on 6th, swing
your jib arms over the avenue.</i>

879
01:43:08,209 --> 01:43:12,973
<i>Boom angles at 90 degrees. Spiderman
needs those big boys high and lined up.</i>

880
01:43:13,014 --> 01:43:16,103
<i>Let's give him a
clear approach, over.</i>

881
01:45:47,761 --> 01:45:50,441
Dad, I have to get this to Spiderman.

882
01:45:50,483 --> 01:45:52,968
- Get in the car, let's go.
- No, we can stop the lizard.

883
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:56,539
- You don't understand!
- I do.

884
01:45:56,576 --> 01:46:00,464
Your boyfriend is a man
of many masks, I get it.

885
01:46:00,505 --> 01:46:03,910
Give me this, get in the car.

886
01:46:07,113 --> 01:46:10,400
Please make sure he's OK.

887
01:46:22,099 --> 01:46:24,590
<i>Initializing GANALI device.</i>

888
01:46:24,627 --> 01:46:29,312
<i>Detonation in T minus 2 minutes.</i>

889
01:47:50,495 --> 01:47:54,899
Poor Peter Parker.

890
01:47:54,934 --> 01:47:59,310
No mother, no father.

891
01:47:59,588 --> 01:48:02,290
No uncle.

892
01:48:02,325 --> 01:48:04,960
All alone.

893
01:48:04,998 --> 01:48:07,880
He's not alone!

894
01:48:25,383 --> 01:48:30,024
<i>Detonation in T minus 45 seconds.</i>

895
01:48:36,824 --> 01:48:39,625
Hey, gift from Gwen!

896
01:48:40,908 --> 01:48:44,028
I got this Peter, go!

897
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:52,030
<i>T minus 45 seconds.</i>

898
01:49:08,518 --> 01:49:12,993
<i>Detonation in T minus 10 seconds.</i>

899
01:49:13,036 --> 01:49:18,038
<i>9, 8, 7...</i>

900
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:24,441
<i>6, 5, 4...</i>

901
01:49:24,842 --> 01:49:31,005
<i>3, 2, 1</i>

902
01:51:13,036 --> 01:51:15,438
The captain.

903
01:51:15,479 --> 01:51:17,838
Captain!

904
01:51:19,558 --> 01:51:24,079
- The lizard...
- It's alright, we stopped him.

905
01:51:24,116 --> 01:51:27,556
Let's get you out of here.

906
01:51:29,842 --> 01:51:32,962
Look at me, stay with me.
Help is on the way, OK?

907
01:51:32,999 --> 01:51:39,044
You need to...you need to be gone,
when they get here, OK?

908
01:51:39,083 --> 01:51:43,845
- I'm not going anywhere.
- I was wrong about you Peter.

909
01:51:44,083 --> 01:51:47,731
This city needs you.

910
01:51:47,767 --> 01:51:51,848
Here, you're gonna need this.

911
01:51:54,569 --> 01:51:58,171
You're gonna make enemies.

912
01:51:59,053 --> 01:52:02,536
People will get hurt.

913
01:52:02,571 --> 01:52:06,570
Sometimes people closest to you.

914
01:52:08,494 --> 01:52:12,371
So I want you to
promise me something, OK?

915
01:52:12,407 --> 01:52:17,777
Leave Gwen out of it.

916
01:52:18,574 --> 01:52:22,376
Promise me that.

917
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:29,380
You promise me.

918
01:53:42,195 --> 01:53:45,551
<i>An eerie calm has set
in over New York city.</i>

919
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:51,258
<i>Apparently some sort of aerosolized
antidote was launched from Oscorp Tower,</i>

920
01:53:51,293 --> 01:53:54,330
<i>which seems to have counter
acted the bio toxins.</i>

921
01:53:54,373 --> 01:53:56,811
<i>Residents of lower
Manhattan can rest peacefully,</i>

922
01:53:56,849 --> 01:53:59,641
<i>knowing that the alleged
mastermind of this terror plot,</i>

923
01:53:59,676 --> 01:54:03,755
<i>Dr. Curtis Connors is behind bars.</i>

924
01:54:41,762 --> 01:54:45,554
Sweetheart, it's OK.

925
01:54:46,231 --> 01:54:50,940
It's alright.

926
01:54:51,144 --> 01:54:54,103
Rough night.

927
01:54:54,137 --> 01:54:57,649
It's gonna be alright.

928
01:55:48,631 --> 01:55:51,627
Where have you been?

929
01:55:59,806 --> 01:56:03,522
My father died.

930
01:56:05,278 --> 01:56:08,872
There was a funeral.

931
01:56:08,911 --> 01:56:15,380
They shot rifles and made speeches.

932
01:56:18,174 --> 01:56:21,645
Two of my teachers showed up.

933
01:56:21,686 --> 01:56:25,082
Flash showed up.

934
01:56:27,874 --> 01:56:32,422
Everyone was there but you.

935
01:56:45,041 --> 01:56:48,236
I can't do it.

936
01:56:49,433 --> 01:56:53,183
- I'm sorry, I can't...
- What are you saying?

937
01:56:53,222 --> 01:56:56,698
I can't see you any more.

938
01:56:57,019 --> 01:57:00,210
I can't.

939
01:57:23,649 --> 01:57:27,639
He made you promise, didn't he?

940
01:57:29,634 --> 01:57:32,429
To stay away from me.

941
01:57:32,464 --> 01:57:35,420
So I'd be safe.

942
01:58:00,095 --> 01:58:02,859
What a pretty girl.

943
01:58:02,892 --> 01:58:06,166
Yeah, that's what uncle Ben said.

944
01:58:06,202 --> 01:58:09,679
Did you ask her out?

945
01:58:11,552 --> 01:58:13,631
Why?

946
01:58:13,667 --> 01:58:18,221
- I can't.
- Why?

947
01:58:20,219 --> 01:58:23,929
I'm just no good for her.

948
01:58:25,326 --> 01:58:29,918
Peter Parker, if there's
one thing you are, it's good.

949
01:58:29,952 --> 01:58:32,992
If anyone has a problem
with that can talk to me.

950
01:58:50,833 --> 01:58:55,150
<i>Peter, I know things have
been difficult lately,</i>

951
01:58:55,183 --> 01:58:58,309
<i>and I'm sorry about that.</i>

952
01:58:58,345 --> 01:59:01,137
<i>I think I know what you're feeling.</i>

953
01:59:01,173 --> 01:59:03,898
<i>Ever since you were a little boy,</i>

954
01:59:03,935 --> 01:59:09,124
<i>you've been living with
so many unresolved things.</i>

955
01:59:09,686 --> 01:59:12,962
<i>Well, take it from an old man,</i>

956
01:59:12,997 --> 01:59:15,993
<i>those things send us down the road,</i>

957
01:59:16,028 --> 01:59:18,467
<i>and make us who we are.</i>

958
01:59:18,507 --> 01:59:24,296
<i>And if anyone's destined
for greatness, it's you son.</i>

959
01:59:24,332 --> 01:59:30,766
<i>You owe the world your gifts, you just
have to figure out how to use them.</i>

960
01:59:30,802 --> 01:59:34,283
<i>And know that wherever they take you,</i>

961
01:59:34,314 --> 01:59:37,235
<i>we'll always be here.</i>

962
01:59:37,355 --> 01:59:40,516
<i>So come on home Peter.</i>

963
01:59:40,551 --> 01:59:45,144
<i>You're my hero and I love you.</i>

964
01:59:52,283 --> 01:59:55,613
- Hello Parker.
- Hey, how's it going?

965
01:59:55,647 --> 01:59:58,900
You coming along man?

966
01:59:58,934 --> 02:00:02,156
That's a cool shirt.

967
02:00:02,194 --> 02:00:05,264
Yeah, dude, dude's crazy.

968
02:00:05,301 --> 02:00:08,342
But chicks dig him.

969
02:00:21,186 --> 02:00:24,594
I had a professor once who liked to
tell his students that there were only

970
02:00:24,627 --> 02:00:28,001
ten different plots in all of fiction.

971
02:00:28,238 --> 02:00:32,701
Well I'm here to tell you he
was wrong, there is only one.

972
02:00:32,740 --> 02:00:34,938
Who am I?

973
02:00:34,970 --> 02:00:38,967
Mr. Parker, tardy again.

974
02:00:39,671 --> 02:00:41,791
Well, at least we can
always count on you.

975
02:00:41,828 --> 02:00:44,450
Sorry Miss Ritter, it won't
happen again, I promise.

976
02:00:44,490 --> 02:00:47,310
Don't make promises you
can't keep, Mr. Parker.

977
02:00:48,877 --> 02:00:51,580
But those are the best kind.

978
02:00:51,618 --> 02:00:55,727
OK class, open your books,
let's begin on page 1.

979
02:02:46,516 --> 02:02:49,054
Hello doctor.

980
02:02:49,090 --> 02:02:51,860
- Did you tell the boy?
- Tell him what?

981
02:02:51,893 --> 02:02:57,041
Did you tell the boy the
truth about his father?

982
02:02:57,081 --> 02:03:00,100
- No.
- That's very good.

983
02:03:00,132 --> 02:03:03,456
We will let him be for now.

984
02:03:03,491 --> 02:03:06,781
You should leave him alone!
