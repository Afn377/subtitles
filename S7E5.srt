1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,575
What have you done?!

2
00:00:39,274 --> 00:00:41,508
- Still at it?
- I think I figured out how

3
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:43,910
to track the thing that attacked us.

4
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:48,181
So... what are we looking at?

5
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,883
A spectrograph from
the scene of the attack.

6
00:00:49,952 --> 00:00:52,852
That is a rare geothermic
isotope that I reprogrammed

7
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:54,521
our satellites to scan for.

8
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,755
If we get a hit...

9
00:00:55,824 --> 00:00:58,658
Then we can track our target.

10
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:01,094
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

11
00:01:02,898 --> 00:01:05,365
Barry, you've been at this all night.

12
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:07,968
Maybe you should take a
break and get some rest.

13
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:10,971
I'm not gonna rest while
that thing is still out there.

14
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,473
Besides, with Ralph
overseas for a while,

15
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,341
and Frost still recovering...

16
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:19,445
Oh, I'd say she's more
than just recovering.

17
00:01:20,683 --> 00:01:23,850
Check out this frosty twist.

18
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:33,092
Are my back meds still wearing off?

19
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,260
I'm seeing double.

20
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:35,729
Yeah, you and me both.

21
00:01:35,798 --> 00:01:38,765
I know this is a lot to take in.

22
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:41,868
Told you they'd freak.

23
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:07,105
www.TUSUBTITULO.com
-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

24
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:23,744
Cecile.

25
00:02:34,443 --> 00:02:37,891
Cecile.

26
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,006
Who are you?

27
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:55,308
What do you want?

28
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:58,511
It's time to come home now, Cecile.

29
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:05,419
- Get away from me.
- You cannot control me.

30
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:08,622
You never did learn your lesson.

31
00:03:29,445 --> 00:03:31,011
Babe!

32
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:34,147
Cecile, Cecile. What's wrong?

33
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,549
You were screaming.

34
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:37,550
No, no, no. I saw... I saw someone.

35
00:03:37,619 --> 00:03:41,154
I saw someone, they were
right there and then they...

36
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:43,289
There's no one here. No one else here.

37
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:45,191
Except us.

38
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,993
You've been working
too hard on those cases,

39
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:48,695
must have fallen asleep.

40
00:03:48,764 --> 00:03:50,430
It felt so...

41
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,834
But the...

42
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:56,870
The danger, it was... it was so real.

43
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,271
It was so real.

44
00:03:58,339 --> 00:03:59,439
I'm sure it was, babe,

45
00:03:59,508 --> 00:04:03,577
but nightmares can't hurt you.

46
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:13,753
So, you remember when
Mirror Monarch blasted me

47
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:15,054
- with her gun?
- Mm-hmm.

48
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:16,756
Well, ever since that blast,

49
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:19,292
we've had these crazy headaches.

50
00:04:20,462 --> 00:04:23,397
Last night, everything gets fuzzy,

51
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:24,898
Caity passes out.

52
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:27,400
And then we wake up... totally fine.

53
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:30,536
But there's two of us.

54
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,241
Uh, Eva's mirror gauntlet

55
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,110
contained a reflective mirror chip.

56
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:39,946
I think it forced Frost's
cryogenes to rapidly replicate

57
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:43,749
and create a whole new
form so that she could survive.

58
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:46,052
Crazy, right?

59
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:48,855
So can you still hear
each other's thoughts?

60
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:52,491
Nope. Just sweet, sweet silence.

61
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160
And I got to keep my powers.

62
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:55,728
Caity got to keep the doctor stuff

63
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:57,597
and science know-how,
which is fine by me.

64
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,000
You always have felt
like two different people.

65
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:02,669
Now, you just have
two different... bodies.

66
00:05:02,738 --> 00:05:04,270
But don't worry, I'm gonna
figure out a way to get us

67
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:05,739
back together as quickly as possible,

68
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:07,107
because I'm afraid the longer we wait,

69
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:09,743
the harder it'll be.

70
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:12,545
I mean shouldn't we be
focusing on that berserker

71
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:14,648
who killed Abra Kadabra instead?

72
00:05:14,716 --> 00:05:15,649
Frost has a point.

73
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:18,384
Where are we with Fuerza?

74
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:21,955
Fuerza.

75
00:05:22,024 --> 00:05:23,590
Spanish, for strength.

76
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:25,992
Look, She-Hulk was taken, okay?

77
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:27,593
Well, uh, still no sign of her,

78
00:05:27,663 --> 00:05:30,363
but Barry has figured
out how to track her.

79
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:32,766
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

80
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:35,368
'Cause if Fuerza can
survive an antimatter blast,

81
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:38,572
that kind of puts her on a
whole other level of baddie.

82
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,506
Like, a "wet your pants" level.

83
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,646
Satellites detected
an isotopic signature?

84
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:49,182
That's Fuerza. Where's she headed?

85
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:51,651
Here, right now.

86
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:58,324
What's with all this
thunder and lightning?

87
00:05:58,393 --> 00:06:00,493
Is Fuerza a speedster too?

88
00:06:02,698 --> 00:06:04,830
Barry.

89
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:10,904
Who is that?

90
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:32,025
Help me.

91
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:35,562
Help me.

92
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:55,330
I just got the Speed Force
restarted, now this happens.

93
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,333
And what about your
speed? Has it been affected?

94
00:06:58,402 --> 00:07:00,870
No. At least not yet.

95
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:03,272
I'm still trying to figure out
how this is even possible.

96
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,907
I have no idea.

97
00:07:04,976 --> 00:07:06,675
I have never seen biometrics like this.

98
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:09,211
You've never had a god for a patient.

99
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,247
The Speed Force took this
form right after H.R.'s funeral.

100
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:14,983
It's like Zeus coming down from Olympus,

101
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:17,019
disguised as a mere mortal.

102
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:19,588
Okay, but why would a
god be asking for our help?

103
00:07:19,657 --> 00:07:22,057
Whatever the answer is,
I need to figure out a way

104
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:25,193
to accurately monitor her recovery.

105
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:31,400
- Holy mother.
- You good?

106
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:32,901
Yeah, just give me a minute.

107
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,369
She's wearing my
Speed Force gauge now.

108
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:35,771
Right now, it's red.

109
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,105
If it changes, hopefully that'll tell us

110
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:38,207
her power levels are recharging.

111
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:40,375
And if that's the case,

112
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:41,844
maybe she entered a comatose state

113
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:43,612
to help heal herself.

114
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:46,348
Makes sense, and when she recovers,

115
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:49,484
she can tell us who did this to her.

116
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:53,456
It.

117
00:07:53,524 --> 00:07:55,424
Maybe it's the same
thing that can rip through

118
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:58,126
an antimatter bomb
like it's tissue paper.

119
00:07:58,195 --> 00:07:59,928
Those are residual geothermic isotopes.

120
00:07:59,997 --> 00:08:01,229
They're all over her.

121
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:03,799
You think Fuerza did this?

122
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:05,501
Oh, that must have
been one hell of a fight.

123
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,338
Not as big as the fight
we're gonna take to Fuerza.

124
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,541
Okay, but this isn't just
some run-of-the-mill meta

125
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,043
we're talking about here.

126
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:16,545
Whatever Fuerza is,
she's powerful enough to

127
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:18,881
hurt the frickin' Speed Force.

128
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,083
And what if she doesn't wake up?

129
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:22,584
What happens to you?

130
00:08:22,653 --> 00:08:24,920
Look, we've faced big threats before.

131
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:27,456
Crisis, Savitar, Thawne.

132
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:29,659
We beat them all.

133
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:31,626
If Fuerza did do this,

134
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:34,429
she should be afraid of us.

135
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,101
All right, I'll keep
looking for isotopes.

136
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,103
And I'll keep monitoring
the Speed Force.

137
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:46,942
You think Fuerza's gonna come back

138
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:49,377
and finish what she started, don't you?

139
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:53,783
I already watched the
Speed Force die once.

140
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:55,283
I'm not gonna let that happen again.

141
00:09:01,558 --> 00:09:04,493
Yeah... yeah, just call me
when you know something,

142
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:07,329
All right, thanks. Bye.

143
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:08,631
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

144
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,832
Um, Dad,

145
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:12,000
what do you know about the robbery

146
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:13,836
at CC Mercantile?

147
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:15,638
Robber waltzed in and out,

148
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:18,473
because the night guard
was catching Z's at his desk.

149
00:09:18,543 --> 00:09:20,710
Why the interest in an
open and shut case?

150
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:23,312
Well, the guard told "The
Citizen" a different story

151
00:09:23,381 --> 00:09:26,148
this morning and I figure I
can help him get his job back

152
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:28,483
if I can break the real story.

153
00:09:28,552 --> 00:09:30,553
He didn't doze off, Dad.

154
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:33,255
He had a vision of
his abusive stepfather

155
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:35,090
stalking him in the bank,

156
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,859
realer than any nightmare he's ever had.

157
00:09:36,928 --> 00:09:38,928
The robbery went down at 11:09,

158
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,395
- last night.
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:42,064
Around the same time

160
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:45,701
that Cecile was having a nightmare too.

161
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:48,403
Damn.

162
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:49,772
If we've got some kind of

163
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,008
Freddy Krueger meta on our hands,

164
00:09:53,077 --> 00:09:54,777
we'll find him.

165
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:57,112
I'll get Korber to pull any
calls about weird visions.

166
00:10:00,284 --> 00:10:02,050
Kristen Kramer.

167
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:04,252
I'm with the Governor's
Municipal Logistics Commission.

168
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:06,689
I wasn't expecting
you till this afternoon.

169
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:08,090
It's good to finally meet you.

170
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,358
Yeah, I like to get a head start.

171
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:13,628
In my experience, if
you're not early, you're late.

172
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:18,100
You must be the Captain's daughter.

173
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:24,206
I read about how you
survived the abduction

174
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:27,376
into that... mirror dimension, was it?

175
00:10:27,444 --> 00:10:29,077
Sounded terrifying.

176
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,014
I've survived worse.

177
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:34,016
Impressive.

178
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,820
Didn't mean to interrupt.

179
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:39,822
We can chat tomorrow, Captain.

180
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,358
- Lunch is on the governor.
- Sounds good.

181
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:49,297
Where'd she say she was from?

182
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:52,634
State Logistics Commission.

183
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:54,269
Why?

184
00:10:56,674 --> 00:10:59,708
Just another hunch.

185
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,216
Dope belt buckle.

186
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:09,084
Ha-ha. Not a belt buckle.

187
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:11,887
This is the Firestorm Matrix.

188
00:11:11,956 --> 00:11:13,655
Okay...

189
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:15,824
I helped Thawne build it
to combine Ronnie and Stein

190
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:17,960
into Firestorm safely.

191
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:21,296
And... that's gonna help put
me and Caity back together?

192
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:22,764
You can thank Caitlin,

193
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,299
she figured it out.

194
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:27,469
All we have to do is
just reset it to her DNA,

195
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:30,472
and your RNA... we're
basically just resetting

196
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,107
fusion to fission.

197
00:11:32,176 --> 00:11:34,676
This baby just needs
a few hours to charge

198
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:36,545
and that's it!

199
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,547
We can get you back to your normal,

200
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:40,548
two minds, one body existence...

201
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,051
that's a Tuesday for you.

202
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,520
Wow, that was fast.

203
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:47,890
It's not so bad being separate.

204
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:50,292
For Caity, I mean, you know.

205
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:52,527
She can finally watch "This Is Us"

206
00:11:52,596 --> 00:11:54,329
without me screaming
"Turn it off!" in her head.

207
00:11:54,398 --> 00:11:56,966
Frost, what have I said
about disparaging "This Is Us"?

208
00:11:57,034 --> 00:11:59,735
- They're so weepy.
- That cast is too precious

209
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:02,004
for this world. Listen,

210
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:07,609
based on how relieved
Caitlin was to figure out this fix,

211
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:10,112
I'm guessing she actually misses

212
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:13,515
hearing your frosty
tones inside her head.

213
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,818
Okay, I'm done with you.

214
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:20,355
Now we wait.

215
00:12:20,424 --> 00:12:22,057
I want to keep checking the
satellites, make sure we don't

216
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:25,560
get hit with another
isotopic signature surprise.

217
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,051
Whoa.

218
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,419
So that's the Speed Force?

219
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:54,389
Uh, Iris already texted
me about everything.

220
00:12:57,728 --> 00:12:59,728
What's wrong?

221
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:01,796
I had a nightmare,

222
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:05,834
but it was more like a vision.

223
00:13:05,903 --> 00:13:08,136
I don't know, I thought, maybe
with my powers expanding

224
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,205
lately, Caitlin could
check out my noggin.

225
00:13:15,312 --> 00:13:16,578
Hey... hey, are you okay?

226
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:18,113
No, it's happening again,

227
00:13:18,182 --> 00:13:20,449
It... it's like someone's
stabbing my brain.

228
00:13:20,517 --> 00:13:21,784
- I'm gonna get Caitlin.
- No, no, no.

229
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:25,287
Barry, Barry it's...

230
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:26,622
It's not medical.

231
00:13:26,691 --> 00:13:28,456
It's my powers.

232
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:30,325
It's like they're picking up

233
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,761
raw fear.

234
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:37,632
There's a robbery downtown.

235
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:40,435
It's okay, really. I'm fine now.

236
00:13:40,504 --> 00:13:41,637
Are you sure?

237
00:13:41,706 --> 00:13:44,006
Yeah. You should go.

238
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,476
Hey,

239
00:13:47,544 --> 00:13:48,944
I'll keep an eye on her.

240
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:51,046
Go.

241
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:06,161
It's gonna crush us to death!

242
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:10,565
Flash, thank God.

243
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:13,101
You have to stop that
creature, it's gonna kill us!

244
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,811
There's...

245
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:25,780
Where are you...

246
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:28,183
Oh, you gotta go so soon?

247
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:42,064
- Ooh.
- So let me get this straight.

248
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:44,566
You made those guards
hallucinate some kind of

249
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,868
Godzilla rip-off that
almost squashed them?

250
00:14:46,937 --> 00:14:49,071
Well, I suppose that is an accurate,

251
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,874
if not immensely reductive
assessment of the situation.

252
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:55,877
So, yes. I scared the hell out of them.

253
00:14:55,946 --> 00:14:57,846
And that was after showing them a vision

254
00:14:57,915 --> 00:14:59,915
of a dozen bystanders
getting eaten alive

255
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:02,084
by a very hungry kaiju.

256
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:05,554
It's horrifying when
you think it's your turn.

257
00:15:05,622 --> 00:15:08,356
Okay, um, look. Whoever you are,

258
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:10,092
I really don't have time for this.

259
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,794
My, my. How rude.

260
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:16,164
And from a superhero?
Is that actually allowed?

261
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:19,334
Okay, I apologize for the rudeness.

262
00:15:19,403 --> 00:15:21,369
But I hope you enjoy Iron Heights.

263
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:23,939
'Cause I really do have
bigger problems today.

264
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:27,042
Not yet, but you're about to.

265
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:31,113
Hey, I just got another
geothermic isotope reading.

266
00:15:33,284 --> 00:15:35,283
It's coming from your location.

267
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,691
Scared yet?

268
00:15:44,428 --> 00:15:46,694
You will be.

269
00:15:55,512 --> 00:15:56,959
Jesus. Damn.

270
00:15:58,342 --> 00:16:01,143
You can't stop me, Flash.

271
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,611
And you never will.

272
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:06,315
No, I'm not afraid of you anymore.

273
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,617
This is just a hallucination.

274
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:11,019
Which means you can't hurt me!

275
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:13,422
Time to repent.

276
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,345
You lose, Barry.

277
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,123
Barry?

278
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,059
Barry!

279
00:16:56,494 --> 00:16:57,859
Your vitals were spiking,

280
00:16:57,928 --> 00:16:59,528
but they seem to have stabilized.

281
00:16:59,597 --> 00:17:01,463
Your speed healing kicked in.

282
00:17:01,532 --> 00:17:04,533
What the hell happened out there?

283
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:08,270
I... I was hallucinating.

284
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:12,208
Thawne, Savitar...

285
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:13,609
they were trying to kill me.

286
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:14,943
It was like...

287
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:17,579
Like a nightmare come to life?

288
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:18,880
Yeah.

289
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:21,617
Like the guards in the truck.

290
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:25,554
Wait, like you. You had
a nightmare last night.

291
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:27,256
Yeah.

292
00:17:27,325 --> 00:17:30,826
Someone is broadcasting
fear into their victims,

293
00:17:30,894 --> 00:17:33,129
and I'm tuning into it like an antenna.

294
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:34,263
Fear I get.

295
00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:35,564
Hallucinations can make you

296
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:37,566
freak out but not bleed out.

297
00:17:37,635 --> 00:17:39,135
Whoever's doing this must be inciting

298
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:41,336
extreme psychosomatic reactions.

299
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:44,172
Barry's mind literally tricked
his body into hurting itself.

300
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:47,476
So if you die in the hallucination...

301
00:17:47,545 --> 00:17:49,111
Then you die in real life.

302
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:50,946
Well, he carried traces
of the same isotopes

303
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:52,381
we linked to Fuerza.

304
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,716
That means we can track him too, right?

305
00:17:54,785 --> 00:17:56,184
Right. And it means that

306
00:17:56,253 --> 00:17:59,855
Fuerza and Psych must
be connected somehow.

307
00:17:59,924 --> 00:18:00,956
Psych?

308
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:02,524
He's a psychic psychopath,

309
00:18:02,593 --> 00:18:04,059
causing psychosomatic symptoms,

310
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:05,828
I mean, the guy
practically named himself.

311
00:18:05,896 --> 00:18:08,831
He's only dangerous
'cause he got inside my head.

312
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:10,499
Cisco, do we still have
the mental dampeners

313
00:18:10,568 --> 00:18:11,667
we used to fight Grodd?

314
00:18:11,735 --> 00:18:13,068
We can try and repurpose them

315
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:14,670
to repel Psych's hallucinations.

316
00:18:14,738 --> 00:18:16,238
Do it. If we can keep Psych

317
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:18,674
out of our heads, he can't hurt us.

318
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:23,211
What?

319
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,713
That must have been terrifying,

320
00:18:24,782 --> 00:18:26,982
being trapped in that nightmare.

321
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:29,351
I mean, I'm... I'm fine.

322
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:31,553
Really, I'm fine. I mean,

323
00:18:31,622 --> 00:18:34,056
we beat those Big Bads already.

324
00:18:34,124 --> 00:18:36,158
Psych's no different.

325
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:37,593
Barry, uh...

326
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:50,906
You did a background
check on a public official?

327
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:52,741
I've only ever heard
of one other person

328
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,176
using the phrase

329
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:55,744
"if you're not early, you're late."

330
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:57,846
"Citizen" 's go-to military source.

331
00:18:57,915 --> 00:18:59,180
Kramer served.

332
00:18:59,249 --> 00:19:00,849
Yes, she served, but I think

333
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:03,586
she's also lying about why she's here.

334
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:06,589
Dad, I found her file
in the D.O.D. database.

335
00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:08,557
Half of it's redacted.

336
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:10,559
What if she's not here to help?

337
00:19:10,628 --> 00:19:12,528
Iris,

338
00:19:12,597 --> 00:19:14,129
are you sure this isn't a reaction

339
00:19:14,197 --> 00:19:16,932
to what happened with Eva?

340
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,434
I mean, she lied to you for weeks.

341
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:20,536
Dad, I am not afraid
of being deceived,

342
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:23,505
I'm afraid of not trusting my gut.

343
00:19:23,574 --> 00:19:26,408
Something is off with Kramer, I know it.

344
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:30,346
Please, read the file.

345
00:19:30,414 --> 00:19:32,848
Okay, okay.

346
00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:40,255
These rapids are hardcore.

347
00:19:40,324 --> 00:19:42,124
Can Caity swim?

348
00:19:42,193 --> 00:19:44,359
What if... when she and I split,

349
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:46,194
I got swimming, and
now she needs floaties?

350
00:19:46,263 --> 00:19:49,465
No one's gonna
need floaties, all right?

351
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:51,534
You two are gonna be
peanut butter and jellied again

352
00:19:51,602 --> 00:19:53,969
by the time we tear up that river.

353
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:56,071
Frost!

354
00:19:57,408 --> 00:19:58,907
Or not.

355
00:19:58,976 --> 00:20:01,577
The Firestorm Matrix
has been sabotaged,

356
00:20:01,645 --> 00:20:04,112
only someone tried to make
it look like it short-circuited.

357
00:20:04,181 --> 00:20:05,781
Before you go blaming Frosty...

358
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:07,950
I ran the adapter
through an infrared scanner,

359
00:20:08,018 --> 00:20:09,418
and guess what the temperature was?

360
00:20:09,487 --> 00:20:12,354
162 degrees.

361
00:20:12,423 --> 00:20:14,656
Fine, I broke your
stupid, precious Matrix.

362
00:20:14,725 --> 00:20:16,024
Why?

363
00:20:16,093 --> 00:20:17,593
Why would you do that to us?

364
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:19,995
It'll be weeks before
we can even consider

365
00:20:20,063 --> 00:20:21,497
another fusion attempt.

366
00:20:21,566 --> 00:20:24,733
Because, maybe I
don't want to recombine!

367
00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:26,034
Why not?

368
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:30,706
Well...

369
00:20:33,344 --> 00:20:35,744
Call me when you figure it out.

370
00:20:45,155 --> 00:20:46,455
You know,

371
00:20:46,524 --> 00:20:48,123
this actually reminds me of that scene

372
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:50,759
where Rebecca and Jack are fighting...

373
00:20:50,828 --> 00:20:52,961
Oh, look at that.

374
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,297
Let's go, we gotta go.

375
00:20:57,535 --> 00:20:59,567
Satellites picked up
Psych's isotopic signature

376
00:20:59,637 --> 00:21:01,236
downtown at the Clearly Capital offices.

377
00:21:01,305 --> 00:21:02,971
Time to put these
mental dampeners to work.

378
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,773
And kick some psychic butt.

379
00:21:07,377 --> 00:21:11,112
5.3 trillion gone.

380
00:21:11,181 --> 00:21:12,981
It's all gone.

381
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,983
Oh, God. I'm ruined.

382
00:21:17,554 --> 00:21:19,488
Hey, i-it'll bounce back.

383
00:21:19,557 --> 00:21:22,357
The DOW only dropped 789 points.

384
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:24,760
It'll bounce back. It has to.

385
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:28,831
Oh, I could do this all day.

386
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:38,740
Oh, it's you again.

387
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:40,308
Well, that's disappointing.

388
00:21:40,377 --> 00:21:42,411
We're not gonna let
you hurt any more people.

389
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,345
Oh, I haven't hurt anyone today.

390
00:21:44,414 --> 00:21:47,248
I have freed them from
a system that brings

391
00:21:47,317 --> 00:21:50,251
fortune to the fortunate
and dooms the rest.

392
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,254
Pretty poetic, don't you think?

393
00:21:53,323 --> 00:21:54,956
What... what is this guy's deal?

394
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:56,992
I think he's overcompensating.

395
00:21:57,061 --> 00:21:59,627
I don't like your friends, Flash.

396
00:21:59,697 --> 00:22:03,299
Also, if you think your flimsy
dampeners can stop me,

397
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:06,234
perhaps you all could
use some freedom too.

398
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:18,580
Killer Frost?

399
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:20,816
You're under arrest for
your crimes against the city.

400
00:22:20,884 --> 00:22:22,150
What? No.

401
00:22:22,219 --> 00:22:23,551
No, I'm one of the good guys now.

402
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,153
Tell it to Judge Tanaka.

403
00:22:25,222 --> 00:22:27,055
We have a witness.

404
00:22:27,124 --> 00:22:29,057
One who told us everything you've done.

405
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:31,326
Who turned me in? Was it Mark?

406
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:33,161
No.

407
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,563
It was Caitlin Snow.

408
00:22:35,632 --> 00:22:37,399
No.

409
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:39,134
No, no, no.

410
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:40,802
How could she...

411
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,941
No.

412
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:50,311
This can't be how it ends.

413
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,480
How could she?

414
00:23:14,138 --> 00:23:16,638
Someone's back for seconds.

415
00:23:16,707 --> 00:23:19,107
You already showed
me my greatest fear.

416
00:23:19,176 --> 00:23:20,575
It won't scare me twice.

417
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:22,143
Oh, Flash.

418
00:23:22,212 --> 00:23:24,980
Those Big Bads aren't
your greatest fear.

419
00:23:25,048 --> 00:23:26,748
This is.

420
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:46,635
No. No.

421
00:23:54,945 --> 00:23:56,411
No.

422
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:58,513
No, please...

423
00:24:00,785 --> 00:24:03,452
No, no, no, no...

424
00:24:08,926 --> 00:24:10,058
No.

425
00:24:14,264 --> 00:24:16,031
Sweet nightmares, people.

426
00:24:34,826 --> 00:24:36,492
First Fuerza, then the
Speed Force shows up,

427
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,093
now this too?

428
00:24:38,162 --> 00:24:39,528
Why can't I stop shaking?

429
00:24:39,597 --> 00:24:41,464
Your biometrics are all elevated.

430
00:24:41,533 --> 00:24:43,465
I mean, your amygdalae are in overdrive.

431
00:24:43,534 --> 00:24:45,167
Wait, we had panic attacks?

432
00:24:45,236 --> 00:24:47,503
Extreme ones, Psych
doesn't just manipulate

433
00:24:47,572 --> 00:24:49,205
your fear, he elevates it.

434
00:24:49,273 --> 00:24:51,941
But your cortisol levels
are slowly stabilizing,

435
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,209
- which means...
- Psych's powers

436
00:24:53,277 --> 00:24:54,610
have a residual effect.

437
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:56,679
And Barry has had a double dose.

438
00:24:56,748 --> 00:24:57,880
Where's Frost?

439
00:24:57,949 --> 00:25:00,315
She wanted to be alone.

440
00:25:00,384 --> 00:25:03,185
Even the Ice Queen was
freaked out by whatever she saw.

441
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:04,753
The mental dampeners didn't work.

442
00:25:04,822 --> 00:25:07,056
Psych must have
overpowered their circuitry.

443
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:09,358
Which means, the
next time you fight him,

444
00:25:09,427 --> 00:25:10,559
we won't be able to protect your mind.

445
00:25:10,628 --> 00:25:12,161
The next time?

446
00:25:12,229 --> 00:25:13,495
How are we supposed to anticipate him?

447
00:25:13,564 --> 00:25:14,564
Stake out the banks?

448
00:25:14,632 --> 00:25:16,398
No, he's not after money.

449
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:19,568
Remember, he said
he... he wants to free people

450
00:25:19,637 --> 00:25:22,038
from the power it has over them.

451
00:25:22,106 --> 00:25:23,506
So what? He has an axe to grind

452
00:25:23,575 --> 00:25:25,041
- with the system?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

453
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:27,076
It explains why he attacked

454
00:25:27,144 --> 00:25:29,178
the Cleary Capital offices.

455
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:31,346
He doesn't want cash.

456
00:25:31,415 --> 00:25:32,582
He wants chaos.

457
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:35,585
Well, he got it.

458
00:25:37,055 --> 00:25:39,254
What exactly did he make you see?

459
00:25:41,926 --> 00:25:43,259
Just...

460
00:25:43,327 --> 00:25:45,594
Kamilla, in danger.

461
00:25:45,663 --> 00:25:48,030
What about you? What did you see?

462
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:49,765
It doesn't matter.

463
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,701
What if it does?

464
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:53,369
What if there's, like, a clue or
something in what you saw...

465
00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:55,171
There isn't.

466
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:56,939
Well, you don't know that.

467
00:25:57,008 --> 00:25:59,408
Look, you're gonna have to
face him again, eventually.

468
00:25:59,477 --> 00:26:01,110
Well, what if I can't, all right?

469
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:04,046
What if he's too powerful
and I can't stop him?

470
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:05,214
Barry, no one said...

471
00:26:05,283 --> 00:26:06,315
You didn't have to.

472
00:26:06,383 --> 00:26:07,749
Maybe, Psych's gonna destroy

473
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:09,118
this whole city and everyone in it.

474
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:10,986
There's nothing I can do about it.

475
00:26:27,872 --> 00:26:29,939
Trying to reconnect the transmitter

476
00:26:30,008 --> 00:26:32,842
to the output circuit?

477
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:34,443
Turns out I'm better
at breaking things

478
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:36,578
than I am at fixing them.

479
00:26:37,815 --> 00:26:39,915
Do you want to tell me
what scared you so much

480
00:26:39,984 --> 00:26:42,885
when Psych whammied you?

481
00:26:42,954 --> 00:26:44,987
Come on, we used to share a brain.

482
00:26:45,056 --> 00:26:46,688
I know you don't scare easy.

483
00:26:51,963 --> 00:26:53,429
I was under arrest,

484
00:26:53,497 --> 00:26:57,166
for all the crimes I
committed as Killer Frost.

485
00:27:00,337 --> 00:27:02,805
And you were the one who turned me in.

486
00:27:02,874 --> 00:27:04,439
I would never do that.

487
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,909
I know.

488
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:12,714
Look, ever since you
let me take the wheel,

489
00:27:12,784 --> 00:27:14,183
I got to live my life,

490
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:17,419
not just half the
time, but all the time.

491
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:22,191
And I really liked it.

492
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,559
And I don't want to go back

493
00:27:23,628 --> 00:27:27,063
to living my life just half the time.

494
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:32,101
And I was afraid you'd
hate me for saying that.

495
00:27:33,805 --> 00:27:36,205
I would never hate you.

496
00:27:36,273 --> 00:27:38,040
You're my sister.

497
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:39,942
You can always tell me how you feel.

498
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,347
I don't know how.

499
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:47,817
I mean...

500
00:27:47,885 --> 00:27:50,620
I may be the strong one, but...

501
00:27:50,688 --> 00:27:52,154
you're the brave one. I mean,

502
00:27:52,223 --> 00:27:53,889
you're fearless!

503
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:56,225
I mean, ever since I got
in touch with my feelings,

504
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:57,960
I just...

505
00:27:58,029 --> 00:27:59,862
I'm scared,

506
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:02,665
all the time.

507
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:04,966
Sometimes I don't even know why.

508
00:28:05,036 --> 00:28:08,303
You think you're the only one
who gets scared sometimes?

509
00:28:08,372 --> 00:28:09,538
Ever since we separated,

510
00:28:09,607 --> 00:28:12,041
there's been this deafening silence

511
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,844
inside my head, where you used to be.

512
00:28:14,912 --> 00:28:18,080
And it terrifies me.

513
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:19,514
That's why I've been so desperate

514
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:22,218
to put us back together.

515
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:25,887
Why I got so upset when
you broke the Matrix.

516
00:28:28,525 --> 00:28:30,860
It's 'cause my biggest fear in life

517
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:32,628
is living without you.

518
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,866
Mine too.

519
00:28:39,203 --> 00:28:42,771
Well, why don't we
face that fear together?

520
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,373
You mean...

521
00:28:44,442 --> 00:28:49,044
Maybe two Snows,
really is better than one.

522
00:28:49,113 --> 00:28:50,446
My apartment has an extra bedroom.

523
00:28:50,514 --> 00:28:52,647
I could use a roommate, what do you say?

524
00:28:56,688 --> 00:29:00,022
I say...

525
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:02,224
"This Is Us."

526
00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:19,074
Cecile, I'm sorry. I
just... um, needed a minute.

527
00:29:19,143 --> 00:29:20,776
Okay.

528
00:29:23,481 --> 00:29:25,281
You do know that you're
not the only one who's been

529
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:28,183
whammied with more than one
dose of Psych's fear, though?

530
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:33,022
You've been picking up his
energy every time he shows up.

531
00:29:33,091 --> 00:29:36,125
Last night, I saw...

532
00:29:37,395 --> 00:29:39,628
I saw a nightmare,

533
00:29:39,697 --> 00:29:43,832
where I couldn't control my own powers.

534
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:47,068
It was terrifying.

535
00:29:47,138 --> 00:29:50,740
It's been really hard to keep
my own fears at bay today.

536
00:29:50,808 --> 00:29:53,509
I spent last year so afraid
of losing everyone I loved

537
00:29:53,577 --> 00:29:57,579
in Crisis, I never thought I'd
have to face that fear again.

538
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:01,583
Psych showed me...

539
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,753
People I love,

540
00:30:04,821 --> 00:30:07,656
dead.

541
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,391
Fuerza had killed them.

542
00:30:12,363 --> 00:30:14,630
We've taken on the impossible,

543
00:30:14,698 --> 00:30:16,665
so many times.

544
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:22,404
Something about these
new threats feels different.

545
00:30:22,473 --> 00:30:25,040
Bigger.

546
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:28,010
And for the first time since Crisis...

547
00:30:31,648 --> 00:30:33,682
I'm sc... I'm scared.

548
00:30:35,887 --> 00:30:38,587
Sometimes, when I'm scared

549
00:30:38,656 --> 00:30:41,991
I ask myself, "What would The Flash do?"

550
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:44,693
Seriously.

551
00:30:44,762 --> 00:30:46,061
Barry,

552
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,797
you run through fear,

553
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:52,501
every time you save this city.

554
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,203
Honey, you just gotta
find some of that courage

555
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:55,971
for yourself.

556
00:31:00,077 --> 00:31:03,645
Guys, we just detected
Psych's isotopic signature.

557
00:31:03,714 --> 00:31:06,748
It's expanding, all
over Sandoval Heights.

558
00:31:10,321 --> 00:31:12,354
Cecile,

559
00:31:12,423 --> 00:31:16,325
you sent your own fear into Top.

560
00:31:16,394 --> 00:31:19,028
Do you think you could
do that on a bigger scale?

561
00:31:19,096 --> 00:31:21,930
D... Me? No, no way.

562
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:28,037
Barry, I could barely broadcast
one emotion across a room.

563
00:31:28,105 --> 00:31:29,638
Then let's get you some help.

564
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,579
Barry?

565
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:38,881
Are you insane?

566
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,082
I know, it sounds crazy, but,

567
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:43,985
DeVoe built this chair to
expand his mental capacity

568
00:31:44,054 --> 00:31:44,987
on a massive scale.

569
00:31:45,056 --> 00:31:46,388
Yeah, yeah,

570
00:31:46,457 --> 00:31:48,557
and it turned him into a supervillain!

571
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:50,058
But you won't,

572
00:31:50,127 --> 00:31:53,161
'cause you're gonna
use it to save the city.

573
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:08,826
I can feel all your
fear, Central City,

574
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:12,495
and it feels exquisite.

575
00:32:22,542 --> 00:32:24,407
Please... please let me out.

576
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:26,877
Let me out of here, please!

577
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:28,646
It's too much.

578
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:31,715
Too much!

579
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:34,384
I can't take it!

580
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,454
Mom, Dad?

581
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,990
Please don't leave me here.

582
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,092
Why won't you come home?

583
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,929
Get away from me!

584
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,867
- Everything's burning!
- Help me!

585
00:32:49,936 --> 00:32:52,836
The walls are closing in!

586
00:32:53,864 --> 00:32:56,198
- Cecile, you good?
- Nope!

587
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:57,532
Not even close to good.

588
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,701
I... I am sitting in a death machine.

589
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,570
What if this thing fries my brain?

590
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:04,139
Wh... what if this chair
turns me evil like the Top?

591
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:05,974
What about that?

592
00:33:06,043 --> 00:33:08,977
As a medical professional,
I promise you will be okay.

593
00:33:09,046 --> 00:33:11,947
- Okay.
- Probably.

594
00:33:12,016 --> 00:33:13,749
Flash, where you at?

595
00:33:13,818 --> 00:33:15,751
I'm approaching Psych's radius.

596
00:33:18,055 --> 00:33:18,987
Okay.

597
00:33:21,158 --> 00:33:22,458
Do it.

598
00:33:26,263 --> 00:33:27,929
I can't breathe!

599
00:33:27,998 --> 00:33:29,731
Make it stop!

600
00:33:32,336 --> 00:33:33,368
It's working.

601
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:35,303
I can... I can...

602
00:33:35,372 --> 00:33:38,707
feel people's minds,

603
00:33:38,776 --> 00:33:43,178
thoughts, all over the city.

604
00:33:43,247 --> 00:33:44,947
I can feel Barry.

605
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,000
His amygdala is spiking.

606
00:34:05,068 --> 00:34:06,367
Barry, can you hear me?

607
00:34:06,436 --> 00:34:08,169
Cecile is connected to your mind.

608
00:34:08,238 --> 00:34:10,138
Whatever you're
seeing, fight through it.

609
00:34:13,243 --> 00:34:15,276
This isn't real.

610
00:34:16,914 --> 00:34:18,546
It's not real.

611
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:21,416
It's not real.

612
00:34:24,421 --> 00:34:26,321
It's not real.

613
00:34:32,596 --> 00:34:35,030
You got us all killed, Barry.

614
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,240
I trusted you.

615
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:47,509
Why didn't you save me?

616
00:35:02,459 --> 00:35:05,827
When you let me die,
you killed our children too.

617
00:35:10,668 --> 00:35:12,534
Barry can't hear us.

618
00:35:12,602 --> 00:35:16,171
He's caught inside his nightmare.

619
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:20,676
He's lost.

620
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:23,612
I'm diverting all satellite
power to the comms.

621
00:35:28,118 --> 00:35:29,885
Listen to me, Barry.

622
00:35:29,954 --> 00:35:31,820
You have to get through this.

623
00:35:31,889 --> 00:35:33,655
Cisco, I don't know if I can.

624
00:35:33,723 --> 00:35:35,791
Yes, you can.

625
00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:38,393
You are strong enough, I know you are.

626
00:35:38,462 --> 00:35:41,096
We can't do this without you.

627
00:35:41,164 --> 00:35:43,331
- You're a coward, Barry Allen!
- You'll lose us again.

628
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:46,101
All because you're too afraid.

629
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,269
Too afraid to open your eyes.

630
00:35:54,377 --> 00:35:55,944
You're right,

631
00:35:56,013 --> 00:35:58,647
I am afraid.

632
00:35:58,716 --> 00:36:01,249
But I won't let that fear control me.

633
00:36:10,027 --> 00:36:10,959
He broke through!

634
00:36:11,028 --> 00:36:13,595
Cecile, now!

635
00:36:13,664 --> 00:36:15,296
Barry,

636
00:36:15,365 --> 00:36:17,699
I can feel your courage.

637
00:36:50,701 --> 00:36:53,101
You're too late, Flash.

638
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:09,417
Guys, it worked.

639
00:37:09,486 --> 00:37:11,319
- Cecile did it.
- I did it.

640
00:37:11,388 --> 00:37:12,487
You did it.

641
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,692
- I did it!
- You did it.

642
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:20,662
Guys,

643
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:23,531
I think I need an energy bar.

644
00:37:31,706 --> 00:37:33,438
Your frontal cortex is healing,

645
00:37:33,507 --> 00:37:35,040
but the part that controls motor control

646
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:36,975
is still falling behind.

647
00:37:37,044 --> 00:37:39,578
No trace of Psych or Fuerza.

648
00:37:39,646 --> 00:37:41,213
Well, either way,

649
00:37:41,281 --> 00:37:44,483
at least now we have
proof they're connected.

650
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:48,087
When I struck Psych with my lightning,

651
00:37:48,155 --> 00:37:50,723
he shook it off easy, but

652
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:53,392
just for a minute, the lightning...

653
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,793
it stayed with him.

654
00:37:54,862 --> 00:37:56,261
Was it glowing?

655
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,964
Yeah.

656
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:01,579
Same thing happened
when you fought Fuerza.

657
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,713
I threw everything I had at them,

658
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,581
we all did.

659
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,983
They just kept coming for more.

660
00:38:07,053 --> 00:38:09,385
Luckily, your powers
are getting stronger, too.

661
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:10,920
Well,

662
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:12,656
chair did most of the work, but thanks.

663
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,224
I don't know, you kicked some

664
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:15,926
pretty serious psychic ass out there.

665
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:18,161
Might have to teach Martian
Manhunter a thing or two.

666
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:21,231
Barry!

667
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,533
Is it Psych?

668
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:25,402
No, no. This is something else.

669
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:29,706
I'm getting the same
readings I got off Nora.

670
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,585
I need to heal myself.
Open the cryo-pod.

671
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:44,254
No, Barry. That'll put you in a coma.

672
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:45,989
It's the only way.

673
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:07,777
Logistics compliance.

674
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,112
Is that what you were doing

675
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,747
when you were working in Gotham?

676
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:12,315
I've made a few trips there.

677
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,917
I'm a big Knights fan.

678
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:16,820
And I called my buddy
who'd been working

679
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:20,324
the Gotham beat for more than a decade,

680
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:23,093
pretty high stakes game you played.

681
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:25,496
And...

682
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:28,432
There is this.

683
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:32,202
So I don't know what your goal is here,

684
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,372
but, if you're gonna
be in my precinct...

685
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:38,809
how about we cut the bull,
and you be honest with me.

686
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:46,717
Fair enough.

687
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:48,151
I wasn't planning to announce this

688
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,655
until I got my bearings.

689
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,223
On the orders of the governor,

690
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,691
I'm here to locate and apprehend

691
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,162
a rogue meta-human, whatever the cost.

692
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,029
And quite frankly,

693
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:03,600
it's about time someone
address the long-standing issue

694
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:06,536
this precinct ignored.

695
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:08,338
You want to arrest The Flash?

696
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:10,674
No... he's clean.

697
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:12,842
So far.

698
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:17,814
I'm here for someone far more dangerous.

699
00:40:17,883 --> 00:40:20,951
The meta-human fugitive
known as Killer Frost.

700
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:37,267
How is he?

701
00:40:37,336 --> 00:40:40,537
Better. I think.

702
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:42,171
Barry's system was overwhelmed

703
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,407
with the same strange signatures

704
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:45,709
that I found in Nora's system.

705
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,411
His vitals have stabilized a bit,

706
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,045
which is good news, but

707
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,947
as to when he'll be fully healed,

708
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:53,417
it's difficult to say.

709
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:57,420
If Psych or Fuerza
were to attack right now,

710
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:58,955
we're totally on our own.

711
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:02,626
Because I wasn't fast enough.

712
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:05,595
Nora.

713
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:08,565
This physical form is new for me.

714
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:11,401
I didn't know its limitations.

715
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,604
I can feel how weak he still is.

716
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:17,173
How weak we both still are.

717
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,510
What happened to Barry?

718
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:23,713
He was attacked by a
powerful meta-psychic.

719
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:26,817
Who showed him his greatest fear?

720
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:31,755
That same psychic was
the second of my attackers.

721
00:41:31,824 --> 00:41:35,692
Fuerza and Psych? They both hurt you?

722
00:41:35,761 --> 00:41:37,628
Who are they?

723
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:40,096
I think...

724
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,065
