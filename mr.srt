00:56:30,486 --> 00:56:33,124
Sorry about that. Back there.

720
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,997
I guess I can't
hide this anymore.

721
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:53,577
Why didn't you tell me?

722
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:56,714
Didn't think it would
make any difference.

723
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:02,984
All I know is that WICKED
must have put me

724
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:04,688
in that maze for a reason.

725
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:06,955
Maybe it was literally

726
00:57:06,957 --> 00:57:08,390
just so they could tell
the difference

727
00:57:08,392 --> 00:57:11,562
between immunes like you
and people like me.

728
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:16,667

still fix this, Newt.

00:57:18,202 --> 00:57:19,901
Okay? We can.

732
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:25,709
Now he needs us.

733
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:30,277
So if there is even
the slightest chance

734
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:31,946
that we can save him,

735
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,952
we can get him out of there,
then we have to take that.

736
00:57:37,386 --> 00:57:39,557
No matter what the cost.

00:57:42,024 --> 00:57:43,593

you're going to save her.

one of them down

It's not about
giving up, Janson.

seriously think...

833
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,886
Don't look at him.

834

Why are you looking at him?

835
01:07:07,689 --> 01:07:09,189
Look at me.

836
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:11,293
He's not gonna help you.

837
01:07:13,964 --> 01:07:16,133
Now, we know you have Minho
in the building.

838
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:18,301
Where?

839
01:07:19,836 --> 01:07:21,935
He's with the others
in holding.

841
01:07:24,408 --> 01:07:26,109

01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:28,778
28.

843
01:07:30,879 --> 01:07:32,645
I can make that work.

No, you guys don't understand.

gonna come with us.

Well, I don't know.

849
01:07:44,859 --> 01:07:47,097
We don't necessarily need her.

850
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:48,765
Right?

851
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:52,633
Not all of her.

852
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:54,901

talk you out of this?

It's your last chance.

You know, it's not like you
to shy away from a fight.

875
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:07,774
And it's not like you
to go looking for one.

876
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:10,077
I just can't help but think
if I walk out that door...

877

our necks out for strangers?

885
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:50,819

getting her serum?

886
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:54,256

888
01:09:58,593 --> 01:10:00,763

she'd still be alive.

889
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:05,267

892

But that was months ago.

893

Thomas, that's not possible.

894
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:27,420
She should have turned by now.

895
01:10:27,422 --> 01:10:29,156
There's no way she
could possibly still...

896
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:30,760
All right, that's enough.

897
01:10:32,462 --> 01:10:33,663
You don't believe me?

898
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:36,600
Do you really
expect me to?

899

a long way together.</i>

1624
02:12:02,181 --> 02:12:05,515
So many have sacrificed
so much

1625
02:12:05,517 --> 02:12:07,386
to make this place possible.

1626
02:12:08,753 --> 02:12:10,256
Your friends

1627
02:12:11,757 --> 02:12:12,958
and your family.

who couldn't be here.

Here's to the friends we lost.

1630

This place is for you.
It's for all of us.

1631
02:12:27,707 --> 02:12:29,275
But this,

1632
02:12:30,109 --> 02:12:32,044
this is for them.

1633
02:12:33,245 --> 02:12:36,649
So, in your own time,
in your own way,

1634
02:12:38,217 --> 02:12:40,119
come make your peace.

1635
02:12:42,253 --> 02:12:44,554

Yeah.

1642
02:13:29,267 --> 02:13:32,004
You had this on you
while you were passed out.

1643
02:13:36,808 --> 02:13:39,212
Figured I'd keep it
safe for ya.

1644
02:13:42,882 --> 02:13:44,784
Thanks, Minho.

1645
02:13:46,785 --> 02:13:48,652

NEWT: <i>Dear Thomas...</i>

1648
02:14:46,878 --> 02:14:50,613
<i>This is the first letter
I can remember writing.</i>

1649
02:14:50,615 --> 02:14:54,384
<i>Obviously, I don't know if I
wrote any before the maze.</i>

1650
02:14:54,386 --> 02:14:59,688
<i>But even if it's not my first,
it's likely to be my last.</i>

1651
02:14:59,690 --> 02:15:02,461
<i>I want you to know
that I'm not scared.</i>

1652
02:15:03,395 --> 02:15:05,194
<i>Well, not of dying, anyway.</i>

1653
02:15:05,196 --> 02:15:08,130
<i>It's more forgetting.</i>

1654
02:15:08,132 --> 02:15:10,032
<i>It's losing myself
to this virus.</i>

1655
02:15:10,034 --> 02:15:12,104
<i>That's what scares me.</i>

1656
02:15:15,641 --> 02:15:18,608
<i>So every night I've been
saying their names out loud.</i>

1657
02:15:18,610 --> 02:15:19,910
<i>Alby...</i>

1658
02:15:19,912 --> 02:15:21,881
<i>Winston, Chuck.</i>

1659
02:15:23,414 --> 02:15:25,549
<i>And I just repeat them
over and over,</i>

1660
02:15:25,551 --> 02:15:27,917
<i>like a prayer,</i>

1661
02:15:27,919 --> 02:15:29,855
<i>and it all comes
flooding back.</i>

1662
02:15:33,225 --> 02:15:34,491
<i>Just the little things,
like the way</i>

1663
02:15:34,493 --> 02:15:35,658
<i>the sun used to
hit the Glade</i>

1664
02:15:35,660 --> 02:15:37,861
<i>at that perfect moment
right before</i>

1665
02:15:37,863 --> 02:15:40,263
<i>it slipped beneath the walls.</i>

1666
02:15:40,265 --> 02:15:43,901
<i>And I remember the taste
of Frypan's stew.</i>

1667
02:15:43,903 --> 02:15:46,271
<i>I never thought
I'd miss that stuff so much.</i>

1668
02:15:49,341 --> 02:15:51,474
<i>And I remember you.</i>

1669
02:15:51,476 --> 02:15:53,843
<i>I remember the first time you
came up in the Box.</i>

1670
02:15:53,845 --> 02:15:55,245
<i>Just a scared little Greenie</i>

1671
02:15:55,247 --> 02:15:57,383
<i>who couldn't even remember
his own name.</i>

1672
02:15:58,482 --> 02:16:00,250
<i>But from that moment
you ran into the maze,</i>

1673
02:16:00,252 --> 02:16:02,687
<i>I knew I would
follow you anywhere.</i>

1674
02:16:04,257 --> 02:16:05,825
<i>And I have.</i>

1675
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:09,628
<i>We all have.</i>

1676
02:16:13,132 --> 02:16:15,331
<i>If I could do it
all over again, I would</i>

1677
02:16:15,333 --> 02:16:20,304
<i>and I wouldn't
change a thing.</i>

1678
02:16:20,306 --> 02:16:23,540
<i>And my hope for you</i>

1679
02:16:23,542 --> 02:16:25,509
<i>is that when you're looking
back years from now,</i>

1680
02:16:25,511 --> 02:16:27,812
<i>you'll be able
to say the same.</i>

1681
02:16:30,649 --> 02:16:34,316
<i>The future's
in your hands now, Tommy.</i>

1682
02:16:34,318 --> 02:16:36,855
<i>And I know you'll find a way
to do what's right.</i>

1683
02:16:38,290 --> 02:16:39,859
<i>You always have.</i>

1684
02:16:41,894 --> 02:16:43,728
<i>Take care of everyone for me.</i>

1685
02:16:45,329 --> 02:16:47,299
<i>And take care of yourself.</i>

1686
02:16:49,167 --> 02:16:51,436
<i>You deserve to be happy.</i>

1687
02:16:54,839 --> 02:16:56,808
<i>Thank you for being my friend.</i>
