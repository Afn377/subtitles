1
00:00:26,143 --> 00:00:28,273
Cisco, what happened?

2
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,706
(Frost), (Frost) ...

3
00:00:45,693 --> 00:00:47,041
(Bar)

4
00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:54,122
(Bar)

5
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:58,250
Help her, help her

6
00:00:59,164 --> 00:01:01,900
(Iris) Iris

7
00:01:10,718 --> 00:01:12,066
Help her

8
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:54,512
Will you be okay?

9
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:58,076
When I pulled Iris out of the mirrorworld and I resisted you

10
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:02,465
This created a molecular anomaly, and it separated all its neurotransmitters

11
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:06,157
Her brain seems to have been rewired - how do we get it back?

12
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:13,282
I don’t know, all we can do now is let her rest while I do more tests

13
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:20,060
Will you be okay?

14
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:26,447
I remember everything how I hurt my team

15
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:31,443
And how she pushed Iris toward the gate, leaving Camila and Singh stranded

16
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:36,700
- I'm sorry - that wasn't you

17
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,610
- Yeah, I was. - No, it wasn't

18
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:43,781
You are not right, believe me, we understand that

19
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,733
So, we'll forget it and go ahead, okay?

20
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:53,774
We're a team, we're protecting each other - we'll find a way to save Iris.

21
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:56,772
And Camila and Singh too, I promise

22
00:02:56,902 --> 00:03:00,378
Eva is still free and I can't stop her because I lost my speed

23
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:04,592
But you'll deter it, I'll do a thorough examination of the artificial velocity field

24
00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:06,330
It worked in the past, and it will work again

25
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:08,632
All we have to do is define ... - No

26
00:03:08,763 --> 00:03:12,238
I am satisfied with this thing, you have seen what was made of me

27
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,886
I'm not (Thon), the connection to the synthetic isn't going to work for me

28
00:03:18,452 --> 00:03:21,797
And since the real velocity field is over

29
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:28,531
- "Central City Police" - this could be delayed

30
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:31,615
- Did your wife try to attack you? Why did your neighbor force you to look in the mirror?

31
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:35,135
Hey, Central City Police here. - If not your uncle, who is he?

32
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:40,784
You want to help bring your daughter here, Mrs. Derbond ...

33
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:43,780
- To get arrested - she's in trouble

34
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:45,735
We want to help her see things more clearly

35
00:03:45,953 --> 00:03:49,210
People change sometimes, overnight

36
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:52,992
Captain, can I talk to you?

37
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,596
- It matters - sorry

38
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:14,366
Miserable, Sue, I thought you were going to disappear with Ralph so we could clear both of you

39
00:04:14,497 --> 00:04:18,755
Yeah, Ralph tracks down the evidence. Arrest me, if I wanted to, I should have come

40
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:22,230
Can you tell me what's going on to push you to risk your freedom?

41
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:26,575
The two people on the inside are not my parents

42
00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:29,703
I know, that sounds hard to believe when (Ralph) mentioned aliens

43
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:32,571
I thought he was too crazy, but I assure you, they are not my parents

44
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:34,873
Yes, I believe you

45
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:40,390
We received more than 100 calls in the past hour with the same complaint

46
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:44,735
Everyone said that people who had known them for years were no longer normal

47
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,168
Do you think this has something to do with the mess at McCulloch?

48
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:52,122
Miserable, I know what's going on

49
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:54,988
step away

50
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,680
What was this?

51
00:05:08,586 --> 00:05:11,236
Chaos raged in downtown Central ...

52
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:15,668
Even so, she's still my grandmother (Rank), you know?

53
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:18,275
Because I was at Geters buying coffee

54
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:22,055
Suddenly, two hands appeared from the table and tried to catch me

55
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:25,227
Luckily, Chester P.Rank is always vigilant

56
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,527
Hey, call me (Joe) No matter what happens outside, it's spreading

57
00:05:30,657 --> 00:05:32,221
- Yeah, Eva's strength is increasing. Right

58
00:05:32,394 --> 00:05:34,784
I analyzed the footage from Eva's live interview

59
00:05:34,915 --> 00:05:40,260
It's not just messing with mirrors but any reflective surface now

60
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:44,430
I think it makes sense, photons are fundamental particles found in all of nature

61
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:50,687
So, as long as there is light from either a natural or an artificial source ...

62
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:52,772
Call Joe back, we need to turn off the lights in town

63
00:05:52,858 --> 00:05:56,160
We can urge the mayor to declare a state of emergency. - Well, I'll take care of it

64
00:05:56,725 --> 00:06:00,071
Why did Eva do this? Why do you want to send us to the mirrorworld?

65
00:06:00,157 --> 00:06:03,242
You want to get rid of us. These are not just kidnappings

66
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:07,066
It is a complete sweep

67
00:06:07,196 --> 00:06:11,279
And with every person you replace, Eva's army grows.

68
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:18,143
Whoops, kidnappers ... What are we going to do now?

69
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:29,743
Director, you must recover

70
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,567
We can't work in The Citizen without you

71
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:38,823
So, please come back to us, okay?

72
00:06:39,954 --> 00:06:43,473
We won't abandon you, especially Barry.

73
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,817
What the two of you is amazing

74
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:55,594
No matter how strong you are separately, you are stronger together

75
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:59,809
Don't let Eva McCulloch ruin the two of you

76
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,153
The mayor is doing everything she can to cut off the electricity

77
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:07,976
(Joe) said it would not be comprehensive but I said we will accept what is possible

78
00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:13,145
Regardless, I'll close all the windows at Star Labs.

79
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,317
We have to cover all the mirrors too and turn off the lights

80
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,879
- Yes, I will take care of it - I hope the townspeople will follow our example

81
00:07:22,183 --> 00:07:27,180
If I had the speed, I would have gone on a ride and helped people stay safe

82
00:07:28,092 --> 00:07:30,134
There has to be a way to save them all

83
00:07:31,003 --> 00:07:37,128
- And recover (Iris) - "There is a way, there is a way ..."

84
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,864
"There is a way, there is a way"

85
00:07:42,082 --> 00:07:43,645
Did you say anything?

86
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:49,641
Hey buddy, where's Barry?

87
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:56,376
(Bari) ...

88
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:08,062
You are powerless, Flash.

89
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:10,410
"But I can help you"

90
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:15,188
- Would you like to help me? - Would you like to help?

91
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:21,096
- Tell me how I saved my wife - she has to get back where she belongs

92
00:08:21,964 --> 00:08:23,312
You all are

93
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:26,266
Return to the world of the mirror

94
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:29,829
You see, in the past 6 years I've seen people like joseph.

95
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,826
And they destroy the blessings around you

96
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:37,606
A glorious world full of wonders

97
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:42,342
You and everyone else on this planet have failed ...

98
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,338
And now, I will fill it with my sons

99
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:52,247
It will be treated by everyone with respect

100
00:08:52,378 --> 00:08:56,332
What will happen to us? You will adapt to your new world

101
00:08:56,418 --> 00:08:58,200
As I did

102
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,674
Don't worry, Barry, I'm not going to kill anyone, I'm not your enemy

103
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:09,800
But I am like a mother to this new and better world

104
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:13,015
You want me to surrender? Just like Ramsay did ...

105
00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:15,187
Ramsay thought he was a hero

106
00:09:15,752 --> 00:09:17,228
But it was not like that

107
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:19,705
As for you, yes

108
00:09:20,748 --> 00:09:25,700
Lead your people to the mirrorworld, they will follow you and be happy

109
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,178
- Were you happy? - Stop resisting me!

110
00:09:28,308 --> 00:09:30,263
You were watching me, Eva.

111
00:09:31,132 --> 00:09:34,303
You know I'm going to risk my life to save this city

112
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:37,301
This is brave words, Flash.

113
00:09:38,301 --> 00:09:44,904
But are you really ready to do whatever it takes to ensure humanity's survival?

114
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,378
My inverter technology applications are endless

115
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:57,330
I can grow crops ten times as abundantly as I can end famine in one day

116
00:09:58,199 --> 00:09:59,720
Why didn't you?

117
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:05,672
Why didn't you do the really important work?

118
00:10:08,236 --> 00:10:12,232
Why not make the world a better place?

119
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:16,707
Because you are helpless

120
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:22,399
I am able, and I will

121
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:28,351
I am not a human being ... but what is better

122
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:33,651
For this, I show you mercy

123
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:35,692
So, please

124
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:43,514
Think about my accident and make the right decision

125
00:10:49,117 --> 00:10:52,768
The satellites have located McCulloch. Barry, I won't lose you either

126
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:54,809
Frost is ready to emerge

127
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:03,151
- That's cool - How did you escape?

128
00:11:03,281 --> 00:11:06,843
- I didn't run away, Eva left me alone - Why? What did she want?

129
00:11:06,974 --> 00:11:10,059
- She wanted to tell us we couldn't win - I hope you answered her firmly

130
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:13,882
No, she's right ... we can't win

131
00:11:45,293 --> 00:11:50,073
- (Nash) - No, my name is Harrison.

132
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:53,765
Dr. (Harrison Wells)

133
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:04,282
Listen, I don't know who you are but I watched Nash die

134
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:06,584
- And all the other Wells characters died with him - to be exact

135
00:12:06,715 --> 00:12:11,798
And when Nash Wells gave his life to provide power for the artificial speed field

136
00:12:12,493 --> 00:12:16,664
Transport all particles from the multiverse of all Wells characters

137
00:12:16,794 --> 00:12:21,312
To the fusion ball except for 1.0 percent, which is me

138
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:24,397
How did the molecules become a person?

139
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:27,656
Lee theory, when Nash and all Wells characters.

140
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:30,871
They stepped out of the chronology asking the universe ...

141
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,434
Act of balance

142
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:38,083
(Wells) has one to compensate for all those losses

143
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,473
Isn't that cool?

144
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:48,727
Crisis, an event happened ... Bring people from other planets here

145
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:50,639
To the same planet in the same timeline

146
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:55,678
Time coalescence? That could explain what happened

147
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:01,631
Of all of Wales's characters

148
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,193
You the one who wanted to meet him the most

149
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:09,495
- I ... - (Barry Allen)

150
00:13:10,842 --> 00:13:12,232
I know

151
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,186
Wells' characters may have passed, but they left an imprint

152
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:21,312
Memories ... so let me say whatever was wrong ...

153
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:26,873
Let me help you with this because she wanted me to

154
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:32,869
You cannot, this enemy that we face is very strong

155
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:38,083
- I also lost my speed - you are the epitome of love

156
00:13:39,212 --> 00:13:42,123
Listen, anyone can save the world with speed and power

157
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:48,031
But this requires a true hero, an unparalleled hero

158
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:51,246
To save him with love

159
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:57,198
What is the meaning of this? - That means, run, Barry.

160
00:13:57,502 --> 00:14:00,544
Run to love

161
00:14:16,445 --> 00:14:18,661
- Nash? Both

162
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:26,222
Allegra, Nash was ...

163
00:14:27,394 --> 00:14:29,088
He loves you so much

164
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:38,342
(Wales) New

165
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:47,726
How is this possible? Hey, you are here to save us, right?

166
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,940
- Besides, which character is this? - I'm the first character

167
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:04,670
Well, I asked Allegra to post a story in The Citizen to warn residents about Eva.

168
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:06,887
- Well done - thank you

169
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:13,144
What is the matter? - This window was covered

170
00:15:13,838 --> 00:15:15,313
where is everybody?

171
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:26,046
I have a strong feeling of passion, confidence and focus

172
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,130
Joe, I ...

173
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:34,301
You have to surrender, Captain

174
00:15:35,344 --> 00:15:37,602
Atmosphere)? Here is Captain West, I ask for support

175
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:41,079
- No one will come, Captain - (Cecil), run

176
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,161
Windows ...

177
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,590
- My phone is not working - it must have disabled transmission

178
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,890
Unfortunately, (Wales), (Wales) ... and this (Wales) too

179
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,409
And Wells too, that's how you got here. Any questions?

180
00:16:05,148 --> 00:16:06,494
- I don't understand how ... - Right

181
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:10,578
Help, guys we need help

182
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,142
(Su), (Ralph)?

183
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:18,486
Where's your face, man? Looks like mashed potatoes

184
00:16:18,616 --> 00:16:22,352
No, his 260 degree body temperature does not touch him

185
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:25,655
You mean someone caused the rubber man to melt?

186
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:28,434
- What a fool - text me (Ralph)

187
00:16:28,565 --> 00:16:29,956
He asked me to meet him at McCulloch Labs.

188
00:16:30,086 --> 00:16:32,866
- He was looking for evidence to acquit you, right? Yes

189
00:16:32,997 --> 00:16:35,690
He thought that there would be no security because of the power outage

190
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:40,209
He was inside when (Eva) blew up the whole place and I was shot

191
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:41,903
He came out carrying this

192
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:47,638
Can you cure it? Well, I'll move it to the biological isolation unit

193
00:16:47,812 --> 00:16:49,811
Okay, we'll go over here from here, Ralph.

194
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:51,939
Come with me, Sue, let me check your arm

195
00:16:54,112 --> 00:16:56,414
This sounds strange

196
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:04,626
- Is there anything? I mean, not quite ...

197
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:08,710
Hey, yeah, ralph found evidence to exculpate Sue.

198
00:17:10,186 --> 00:17:13,140
The hero remains a hero - to be sure

199
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:19,832
I know you still exist

200
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,699
I will never stop fighting to get to you

201
00:17:26,956 --> 00:17:33,343
Maybe this is the epitome of love but it's only because you are in my heart

202
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:42,771
Please ... come back to me

203
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:04,756
I don't understand, exactly how will you be able to regain your speed?

204
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:07,188
Iris is the key

205
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:12,966
- Yeah, I still don't understand - the velocity field, we thought it collapsed, right?

206
00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:16,486
I felt the spark with Iris a while ago

207
00:18:16,616 --> 00:18:18,267
Barry, you lost your speed

208
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:23,481
No, the velocity field is a fundamental part of the universe, so in theory ...

209
00:18:23,655 --> 00:18:29,606
In theory, he might never have collapsed - and you think he's still in Iris.

210
00:18:29,781 --> 00:18:33,039
I always wondered why I was chosen to be the epitome of love

211
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:37,122
And what does that have to do with my speed? I think this is because of my relationship with Iris.

212
00:18:37,253 --> 00:18:42,380
Our love is as strong as the thunderbolt that struck me 7 years ago

213
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,291
And Iris has been enjoying speed in the past

214
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:48,331
And (Nora) was speeding, and her spark was purple and yellow

215
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:49,983
Yeah, how romantic

216
00:18:50,111 --> 00:18:54,501
If the velocity field energy is still in Iris, how do we extract it from it?

217
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:57,194
Well, we have to restart the artificial velocity field

218
00:18:57,326 --> 00:19:00,280
To derive strength from an organic source rather than an artificial one

219
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,973
I can help with this

220
00:19:02,365 --> 00:19:03,928
- Well, I need ... - I'll take care of it

221
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:08,143
If it works, we can play Eva together

222
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:24,633
Let the new life begin, my children

223
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:30,759
Go, just go

224
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:37,840
Open the door

225
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:45,401
It's too late, Captain, this is my mother's world now.

226
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:46,963
- Can she come in? Yes

227
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,049
This door is not designed to withstand a tactical force

228
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:56,478
- It should have been - with these old buildings, there are main pipes

229
00:19:57,477 --> 00:20:00,390
Humans have taken this world for granted, Captain.

230
00:20:01,605 --> 00:20:03,039
We won't

231
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:08,036
I won't leave you, please come Joe.

232
00:20:08,253 --> 00:20:09,644
Kiss me (Jenna) on my behalf

233
00:20:12,163 --> 00:20:13,945
Now, go

234
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:20,330
Okay, I'm done, how long is it yet to reconnect the power supply?

235
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:23,545
- Power cycles have been redirected - and the fusion ball setup re-set

236
00:20:23,676 --> 00:20:26,370
I must say, is this how you guys do?

237
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:30,368
Because all this friction with so much raw energy

238
00:20:30,498 --> 00:20:32,061
This is a big risk

239
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:36,319
Allen, if you're wrong about Iris, every atom in your body will split in half.

240
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,491
‫"(باري)"

241
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:02,996
We need you

242
00:21:04,342 --> 00:21:07,643
- We need you - I'll be fine

243
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:26,934
Energy is increasing

244
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:34,190
"Run, Barry, run."

245
00:21:35,146 --> 00:21:36,927
"Run to love"

246
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:50,308
Yeah, that's the true velocity field

247
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:10,856
- Amazing - normal speed is complete

248
00:22:10,988 --> 00:22:12,683
We need you

249
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:14,681
I need you

250
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:05,252
I knew you would find a way back to me

251
00:23:13,117 --> 00:23:15,246
You will always be my strength

252
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:30,735
Do not be afraid you will go to a better place, I promise

253
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:32,952
Take them

254
00:23:34,386 --> 00:23:35,732
Both

255
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:44,857
No, Flash, you've made up your mind

256
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,680
Now, face the consequences

257
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,938
It's over, Eva.

258
00:23:54,761 --> 00:23:56,411
Why doesn't Flash use its speed?

259
00:23:56,499 --> 00:24:00,540
Its body is made of quantum protons that are capable of a lower speed than light

260
00:24:00,713 --> 00:24:05,623
- So, technically ... - it's faster than him

261
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,288
- Not Cecil. - No

262
00:24:48,852 --> 00:24:50,763
But it is close to here

263
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:54,152
If you want to be with her ...

264
00:24:56,281 --> 00:24:57,803
There is one way

265
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:04,015
Why do I trust you?

266
00:25:15,354 --> 00:25:16,961
You don't have any choice

267
00:25:28,823 --> 00:25:32,340
We could have worked together to achieve the common good

268
00:25:32,428 --> 00:25:36,078
It is too late now the era of the human race is over

269
00:25:36,252 --> 00:25:40,249
My children will occupy the world and I am their mother and daughter

270
00:25:40,379 --> 00:25:45,637
Tonight my reign as Queen of the Mirror World begins

271
00:25:46,331 --> 00:25:48,982
In fact, this is only the beginning

272
00:25:50,893 --> 00:25:53,066
Did you like the sound waves, madam?

273
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,324
But hey, there's more

274
00:26:01,452 --> 00:26:02,798
Now, Flash!

275
00:26:09,706 --> 00:26:12,878
That's not fair, you brought your team

276
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,614
Maybe I should get my team

277
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,684
It looks like a Saturday night in Iron Heights.

278
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:15,918
Protect me!

279
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,868
- I can't fix these guns in time - you have to think about something else

280
00:27:23,998 --> 00:27:26,866
- Quickly ... - Let's do this

281
00:27:33,644 --> 00:27:35,034
(Frost)!

282
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:51,761
Each villain has a weakness, what did we miss

283
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:56,192
Barry needs more than speed to win this fight

284
00:28:22,521 --> 00:28:23,911
Spend it

285
00:28:26,474 --> 00:28:29,342
Flash, no, Eva, please don't

286
00:28:29,472 --> 00:28:32,644
It's too late for Flash's chance

287
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,164
you too

288
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:40,115
- (Eva), you are destroying this world - No, I am freeing it from being overrun

289
00:28:40,247 --> 00:28:44,330
My children deserve this world more than human beings

290
00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:47,806
I'll deal with it, join the others

291
00:28:50,978 --> 00:28:55,105
- (Eva) - You're not giving up, right?

292
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,451
Ok, bye

293
00:29:22,954 --> 00:29:24,345
This is impossible

294
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,515
I'm still not strong enough to overpower me

295
00:29:29,689 --> 00:29:31,079
- Not yet ... - (Eva)

296
00:29:31,165 --> 00:29:33,902
You told my husband that you wanted to bring peace to this world

297
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:38,419
You are using excessive force against defenseless people

298
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,592
Eva, my surrogate ...

299
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:46,633
She was connected to this world and herself

300
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:51,716
But your other children ... are full of hatred

301
00:29:52,801 --> 00:29:54,148
Look around you

302
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,799
Is this your concept of peace?

303
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:04,228
no no

304
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:22,649
Is this what you really want?

305
00:30:28,557 --> 00:30:31,642
- Back off, this is our chance ... - No, please, just wait

306
00:30:39,855 --> 00:30:41,201
Both

307
00:30:46,195 --> 00:30:47,544
No, I ...

308
00:30:49,803 --> 00:30:51,584
I wanted to improve things

309
00:30:57,102 --> 00:30:59,970
You have failed two worlds

310
00:31:00,577 --> 00:31:03,880
Eva, it's never too late to do the right thing

311
00:31:03,966 --> 00:31:08,137
You told me about your dream of helping people, you still can

312
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:11,700
Here and now, by finishing this

313
00:31:12,917 --> 00:31:16,739
The foundation of a better world is empathy, not violence

314
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:19,737
The true Queen knows this

315
00:31:28,427 --> 00:31:30,729
We'll go, we're going

316
00:31:52,332 --> 00:31:54,331
It doesn't work

317
00:32:04,585 --> 00:32:07,234
They became too powerful to control them

318
00:33:35,344 --> 00:33:36,735
We have succeeded

319
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,077
What about the people we lost?

320
00:34:05,192 --> 00:34:08,754
Commander Singh? Sir, what happened?

321
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:11,707
- Are we ... - dead?

322
00:34:12,361 --> 00:34:15,141
No, policewoman, we are alive

323
00:34:16,183 --> 00:34:21,527
I'm sure we owe our lives to some accelerator, and his wife, too

324
00:34:25,178 --> 00:34:26,524
(Of)

325
00:34:41,861 --> 00:34:46,116
- Is that you, right? No, I'm Shwapaka.

326
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:49,680
It's Camila, the real one if she comes back ...

327
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:52,418
This means that the rest of the people of Central have returned as well

328
00:34:53,113 --> 00:34:56,111
where are you? I'm at the Citizen headquarters.

329
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:59,891
I was in that other place I never thought I would ever leave

330
00:35:00,195 --> 00:35:04,627
Do not leave, I will kiss you as if it is our last day

331
00:35:05,928 --> 00:35:07,711
I love you, camila.

332
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:10,144
Me too

333
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:16,227
Do you want someone to drive you? Ice Bridge, the most secure transportation way

334
00:35:16,355 --> 00:35:18,702
Honestly, I find this hard to believe

335
00:35:20,049 --> 00:35:22,873
So what are you going to do now?

336
00:35:30,216 --> 00:35:31,824
I will return to the world of the mirror

337
00:35:32,954 --> 00:35:35,516
To do what I had to do a long time ago

338
00:35:36,038 --> 00:35:37,428
Starting over

339
00:35:44,508 --> 00:35:48,679
This time, my children will be born out of love, not hate

340
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:52,113
They will be free to choose their own path

341
00:35:59,151 --> 00:36:00,541
Good luck

342
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:21,956
Is there any reference to Eva? Both

343
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:24,692
It seemed the Mirror Realm Queen was really serious about starting over

344
00:36:25,258 --> 00:36:27,474
Iris, what you did there ...

345
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,471
What if you were now a superhuman?

346
00:36:30,603 --> 00:36:34,077
I'm sure Eva stripped me of my power in the mirrorworld when I left

347
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:36,685
Perhaps when she returned to the mirrorworld, she closed the gate ...

348
00:36:36,815 --> 00:36:38,161
Without it, you have no powers

349
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:41,506
Well, the substitutes disappeared and we all got back

350
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,592
(Singh) Derbond and Camila.

351
00:36:44,026 --> 00:36:45,851
It was a good day at work folks

352
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:49,543
Okay, where's O (OG Wells)? He's with Cisco and Allegra.

353
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:51,499
They wanted to bid him farewell individually

354
00:36:54,888 --> 00:36:56,583
Are you sure you should leave?

355
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,146
I heard Team Flash always includes a Wells character.

356
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,883
This is overrated, but Flash has regained its speed

357
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:04,838
The Mirror Realm Queen is back where she belongs

358
00:37:05,837 --> 00:37:08,748
It's time - but I need someone to train me

359
00:37:08,878 --> 00:37:15,091
You have to follow your own path and show that I have my own path

360
00:37:15,221 --> 00:37:17,090
The universe brought me back to life

361
00:37:18,393 --> 00:37:22,476
Somehow, and now, I can see the 92 years of that life

362
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:26,082
Past, present and future simultaneously

363
00:37:26,647 --> 00:37:30,948
And somehow, I can travel to whatever moment I want

364
00:37:31,122 --> 00:37:34,728
Perpetual Wells, that's new

365
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:41,766
This is amazing and of no use if I can't share it with my beloved wife, Tess.

366
00:37:42,549 --> 00:37:44,807
We have had 4 great years

367
00:37:44,938 --> 00:37:46,328
Together, before ...

368
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,499
Before we were killed

369
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:58,102
Now, I have a choice between moving forward from this moment on without it

370
00:37:59,971 --> 00:38:01,882
And back to it

371
00:38:03,924 --> 00:38:07,834
I want to reclaim those 4 years that we spent together

372
00:38:07,964 --> 00:38:12,873
Over and over again, endlessly, until my hour comes

373
00:38:15,177 --> 00:38:16,567
Good luck

374
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:22,302
Allegra, good luck to you

375
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:32,033
I get you, you want to be with the person you love

376
00:38:32,468 --> 00:38:35,900
Camila and I would be lucky if we got half of what I experienced with Tess.

377
00:38:36,031 --> 00:38:37,421
You will

378
00:38:42,722 --> 00:38:44,459
- It's weird, isn't it? - Yes, we just met

379
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,978
- As if I hardly even know you - we hardly know each other

380
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:51,194
- I mean, you don't look like him at all. - Who?

381
00:38:51,324 --> 00:38:56,538
The Harrison Wells you knew - or who you thought was Harrison Wells

382
00:38:57,493 --> 00:39:01,621
- Of course, it turned out to be an idiot. - An idiot?

383
00:39:03,314 --> 00:39:04,705
Yes Yes

384
00:39:07,443 --> 00:39:10,222
How do you miss someone you barely know?

385
00:39:26,516 --> 00:39:31,729
Before you leave, how do you travel through time exactly?

386
00:39:33,077 --> 00:39:39,809
It's easy, just that

387
00:39:52,322 --> 00:39:53,713
that easy

388
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:59,708
Well, we talked to Captain West. Actually, I did.

389
00:39:59,882 --> 00:40:03,315
Ralph's voice scared him - What don't you like about my voice?

390
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:07,615
- Your voice sounds great - Yeah, the helmet reminds me of Daft Punk.

391
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:10,483
What? You know I love dancing so much

392
00:40:10,614 --> 00:40:12,699
Don't do this, don't do, don't do ...

393
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,435
Ralph, don't worry, after a few days in the biological isolation unit, you'll be back the way you were

394
00:40:15,566 --> 00:40:18,651
Anyway, nice to see you again, Caitlyn, and Frost too

395
00:40:18,782 --> 00:40:22,430
After I confirmed my parents' safety and after the police obtained evidence to acquit me

396
00:40:22,604 --> 00:40:25,384
- It's thanks to Ralph ... - We have to celebrate

397
00:40:25,515 --> 00:40:28,340
Sue, have you ever thought about joining Team Flash?

398
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,382
We can hire someone with your skills

399
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:36,029
Me, in the same team with the perfect man who is not good at dancing?

400
00:40:36,724 --> 00:40:38,071
This is not what I like

401
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:40,635
Plus, Ralph and I have work left to do

402
00:40:40,765 --> 00:40:44,762
Blackhall is over, but there is an organization like it in every country in the world

403
00:40:44,892 --> 00:40:46,412
Take advantage of good people like my parents

404
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:49,280
- We'll visit it - get rid of it

405
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:52,322
Ralph, we've been through a lot since you joined this team

406
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,927
Get off this, Barry, don't say goodbye, I'll be back when you least expect it

407
00:40:56,058 --> 00:40:58,838
Frost, we're going on that trip, okay?

408
00:40:58,969 --> 00:41:02,097
- She says, of course - if you need help, just let us know

409
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:04,138
- I'll hurry up to you two. - Thanks

410
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:06,181
Do the same

411
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:09,744
- Come on dude - stay cool, (Debney) departing

412
00:41:09,874 --> 00:41:11,829
They make a great team

413
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:18,128
and we too

414
00:41:27,643 --> 00:41:31,206
"18 hours ago"

415
00:41:49,062 --> 00:41:51,017
